# 'r'	Open a file for reading. (default)
# 'w'	Open a file for writing. Creates a new file if it does not exist or truncates the file if it exists.
# 'x'	Open a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation fails.
# 'a'	Open for appending at the end of the file without truncating it. Creates a new file if it does not exist.
# 't'	Open in text mode. (default)
# 'b'	Open in binary mode.
# '+'	Open a file for updating (reading and writing)

# instead of closing and opening and assigning the file  and target variable so many times , we could have
# used + mode, which allows multiple editing
