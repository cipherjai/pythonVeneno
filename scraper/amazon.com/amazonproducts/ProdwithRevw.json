I was fearing it to be a \"toy\" quality because of it's light weight, but once I turned it on, I was pleasantly surprised.

I attempted to get help from the manufacturer and they simply stop responding after I gave them all of the information. The seller refused to do a return because it was after the date. So I had it working for about 45 days and then it died. I honestly would have been happy if it lasted at least a year for the price I paid but less than 2 months is unacceptable. It is sad that a reseller won't step up and even worse when the manufacturer won't stand behind their products. I hate to give bad ratings but they deserve it.

There was a standard for 3 years 3 device for $79.00 or a deluxe licence  for 5 years unlimited devices (don't have cost).

I do have one minor gripe .. the light on the front-bottom of the set that blinks to tell you when some command is being received from the remote. The only time this light turns OFF is when there is a picture on the screen or when  the set is unplugged. My usage is in the bedroom .. that is supposed to be dark at night. I do not want to get up and unplug the TV at the end of an evening's viewing. There needs to be a way to use the remote to turn this light OFF.

I do intend to mount it on the wall in the future but I think it would do fine on the legs. I like the settings menu, it jumps out from the side.

I don\u2019t use cable btw. Connecting to internet is easy. The menu jumps up from the bottom with all those apps and info as well. I\u2019m pretty impressed with the interface of this tv and I think LG has won me over from Samsung. My Samsung struggled with staying connected to Internet and Netflix etc was always freezing and dropping so I would have to turn it off and back on. I don\u2019t care for the remote it is small and seems cheap. Samsung makes a large remote that\u2019s easy to use and sturdy enough to smack someone with. I have big hands and this remote makes me feel like adre the giant. Bottom line I\u2019m very happy with the tv, I\u2019d buy it again and I\u2019m thinking about getting one for my parents.

The mounts for tabletop use work, but they are quite minimal. Sadly, this TV started having problems on the second day starting with purple vertical bars on the screen that progressed to multiple color bars ending in no picture or sound. I was on the phone for hours with LG trying to resolve it. Resets and power cycles did not resolve it (not surprisingly). LG's support service is lacking with their referral to non-participating service providers and unreachable providers.  After much insistence, my case was apparently escalated, and the issue was to be transferred to LG field support. I was adamantly assured I would be contacted soon on that day. I wasn't. This \"support\" is unacceptable for this product. The support representatives were friendly though, although the inference that this internal hardware issue might be physical damage as not appreciated (presumably as a way to escape support responsibility).

The hardest part of the set up for me was attaching the two little stands (at each end of the set, for placing the TV on a table or stand)--you need a screwdriver, and I found it not easy insert the 4 screws. Also, it takes a while to follow the on-screen instructions to connect the TV to WIFI and to register the TV with Samsung. Too bad that the remote does not have a voice-activation feature, as you have to input quit a bit of info, one character at time, but I guess that's what you have to do now with any other \"smart\" TV. Two suggestions: 1. The stands (as well as the TV) are very lightweight and it seems it would be very easy to tip the set over if you're not careful, so I used black duct tape to \"secure\" the stands to my stand, and that works fine; 2. Consumer Reports has a feature wherein if you input the make and model #, it will prescribe settings that you should follow for an optimal TV picture. (Of course you have to subscribe to CR in order to take advantage of this feature, unless you know someone who is a subscriber.) I must say, that worked very well for me. I sit about 5 to 6 feet away from the TV, and, frankly, I wanted a set size that wasn't overwhelming and \"too too,\" if you know what I mean.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

I do intend to mount it on the wall in the future but I think it would do fine on the legs. I like the settings menu, it jumps out from the side. You have several presets and can adjust all the usual settings: brightness etc. the sound is great, 10 is too loud. Pretty light as expected.

I don\u2019t use cable btw. Connecting to internet is easy. The menu jumps up from the bottom with all those apps and info as well. I\u2019m pretty impressed with the interface of this tv and I think LG has won me over from Samsung. My Samsung struggled with staying connected to Internet and Netflix etc was always freezing and dropping so I would have to turn it off and back on. I don\u2019t care for the remote it is small and seems cheap. Samsung makes a large remote that\u2019s easy to use and sturdy enough to smack someone with. I have big hands and this remote makes me feel like adre the giant. Bottom line I\u2019m very happy with the tv, I\u2019d buy it again and I\u2019m thinking about getting one for my parents.

The mounts for tabletop use work, but they are quite minimal. Sadly, this TV started having problems on the second day starting with purple vertical bars on the screen that progressed to multiple color bars ending in no picture or sound. I was on the phone for hours with LG trying to resolve it. Resets and power cycles did not resolve it (not surprisingly). LG's support service is lacking with their referral to non-participating service providers and unreachable providers.  After much insistence, my case was apparently escalated, and the issue was to be transferred to LG field support. I was adamantly assured I would be contacted soon on that day. I wasn't. This \"support\" is unacceptable for this product. The support representatives were friendly though, although the inference that this internal hardware issue might be physical damage as not appreciated (presumably as a way to escape support responsibility). It might otherwise be a good product, but with LG's failure to resolve the issue, I returned the TV and Amazon was good in that process.

First question that gets asked about this TV is,  is it good enough for 4k? The answer is yes it is.  Even though I mainly brought this TV for 4k gaming but found quickly that this TV does rival all major competitors 4k tvs. After I spent a little time adjusting this TV around I found out really quick that right settings to make the picture look like it does when its sitting at a retail store looking pretty and drawing you in like a fly does to a bright light. These are the settings I found perfect for this tv: vivid picture, dynamic contrast on, color set to warm and make sure noise reduction is off.  Then I tested these settings while watching Netflix 4k.  Trust me when I tell that the picture quality blew my mind while watching crouching tiger hidden Dragon 2 and sense 8 on Netflix 4k.  I know Alot people are saying they can't tell the difference between 4k and 1080p but trust you can tell the difference.  What you do is watch something in 4k and then downscale the resolution to 1080p and trust you'll see the difference.  This is the same thing that everyone did with HD over SD when HD first came out.  The picture quality is totally bonkers. I've invited numerous friends over and they all were blown away from how great the picture quality is.  Some of these friends have LG and Samsung 4k tvs that spent $2000 plus on.  Did I mention that this TV doesn't have any motion blurring either and which I found turning on the memc 120hz feature pointless.  This TV is extremely awesome if you're like me and play 4k games on PC then this TV is perfect.  This TV actually performes like a monitor rather than a TV. This TV only has 8ms input lag which is beyond outstanding for a TV.  Graphics are unreal in 4k on this TV.  Call of duty looks like a cgi movie.  Those who use keyboard and mouse I found it that this TV has very little lag so that using keyboard and mouse is awesome as well.  The only gripes that I have with this TV is that it only has 1 4k 60hz port which sucks cause I use my PC and nvidia shield box to stream Netflix 4k. Amazon does sell a hdmi 2.0 splitter box for $60 but for now just switching out the cables is fine for me. The other issue I have and maybe it's my set but this TV from time to time will show unsupported mode whenever it doesn't pick up on the 4k signal right and I have to switch input ports back and forth to fix it. I'm going to contact the manufacturer about this. Other than those issues this TV has blown my mind on the picture quality and PC gaming. If you're sitting wondering if you should get this TV after seeing the cheap price tag then I say go for it.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

All attached devices can be controlled with the included OneRemote, which again syncs automatically, you simply point the remote at the device and it recognizes, and controls it. Altogether, set up will take you about 5-10 minutes, and once it's complete you are left with the most incredible picture you have ever seen. The details and colors are so vibrant and vivid, and there is ZERO glare, as the screen adjusts to ambient light, which is great for us as our apartment is all windows. Perhaps my favorite feature is the Universal Browse, which allows me to access my favorite programming from cable, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and beyond, all from one universal guide. My girlfriend loves the TV in ambient mode, which allows us to display art like content, photos, or decorative backgrounds (perfect for when we have people over and want to show off our QLED without having the television on). If you're going to spend the money on a nice television, I absolutely recommend spending it here, worth every penny. Well done Samsung!", "verification": null, "product_type": "\n      Size: 65-Inch"}},

That is why I am writing this review. When I first started trying to set up this TV, I looked around for calibration settings that other people used, but the only ones I could find were on RTINGS.com. However, the calibration settings they used made everything look terrible. Instead, I used calibration settings for another SONY TV and played around a lot before I finally got the picture and sound the way I wanted it.

I use it to turn down commentators all the way in football games when I just want background noise, it's great!

While the TV does require two people to set it up due to the screen size, it is surprisingly light and the set up is extremely simple, my girlfriend and I were able to get this out of the box and playing chef's table 4k in less than 10 minutes. Once the TV is out of the box, the form and design is something to marvel at. The TV is so thin and its frame is virtually invisible, this device is all screen. The stand legs just snap onto the TV with virtually no assembly required, I spent a good two minutes looking for the screws before my girlfriend just snapped the legs into place herself (which of course gave her much triumphant satisfaction!) The on-screen set up is a breeze, and the TV is so smart it automatically detects and syncs your connected devices (cable box, video game console, external speakers etc). All attached devices can be controlled with the included OneRemote, which again syncs automatically, you simply point the remote at the device and it recognizes, and controls it. Altogether, set up will take you about 5-10 minutes, and once it's complete you are left with the most incredible picture you have ever seen. The details and colors are so vibrant and vivid, and there is ZERO glare, as the screen adjusts to ambient light, which is great for us as our apartment is all windows. Perhaps my favorite feature is the Universal Browse, which allows me to access my favorite programming from cable, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and beyond, all from one universal guide. My girlfriend loves the TV in ambient mode, which allows us to display art like content, photos, or decorative backgrounds (perfect for when we have people over and want to show off our QLED without having the television on). If you're going to spend the money on a nice television, I absolutely recommend spending it here, worth every penny. Well done Samsung!", "verification": null, "product_type": "\n      Size: 65-Inch"}},

It is still running fine.  But, I just began to notice that Sony products are still well reverred & there are many Sony enthusiasts out there.  Sony used to be ranked #1 but Samsung has had that spot for past decade.  After weeks of research I decided to give Sony a place in my home.  So far I can say that I absolutely love the remote and the way the app interface is designed.  There is a user friendly & intuitive quality to both.  But, it's the picture quality that is primarily important.  I am quite pleased with the picture.  It has a richness & contrast that are very true to life.  I purchased a Sony 4k Bluray player & Sony sound bar to optimize the overall ease of operation and viewing & listening experience.  Since what's the point in owning a 4k television & not be able to see 4k movies?  Obviously the slim shape of today's televisions leaves the audio lacking so a sound bar addition is important to enhance the sound quality.  I want to say that I have not changed any of the factory picture settings, they seem perfect.  And, I'm usually very picky!  The picture & sound offers many unique mode settings which I am looking forward to checking out in the weeks ahead.

When you plug in a device in one of the HDMI ports it might not give you HDR right away, specially with the apple TV 4k which is really demanding when it comes to activating HDR. It took me a while to figure it out and I was blaming my receiver or the cables (some cables might give you issues sometimes. If you want 4K hdr try to stick to cables of up to 6ft, specially if you're going through a receiver) but just plugging the HDMI cable on a different port on the TV solved the problem and once you get it working, it stays that way.", "verification": null, "product_type": "\n      Size: 82-Inch"}},

The Roku interface is also fairly intuitive and allows access to a fair amount of free content. This would have been an easy 5 star rating had the TV not died. Customer support was responsive, but we still needed to go through the obligatory 3 hours of troubleshooting. After multiple resets, reboots, restarts, power-ups, etc., they finally decided to send out a tech with a replacement part. Obviously they know what the issue is and have come across it previously. Yes, I could have sent it back, but re-boxing the unit would have been a royal pain. Further, I like the TV. I'm hoping the replacement part is an upgraded one that will hold up better.

There are other more granular settings that you can play with.

I contacted the seller and they responded quickly but just said same thing different models for different companies and I could return in if not pleased.

I noticed Walmart has the same model I received and it\u2019s $50 less then what I paid plus it\u2019s in stock would wouldn\u2019t of had to wait.  I was going to get that before I ordered the model I did but the U658 version is advertised as \u201c2018 model\u201d. Anyway,  I did contact SCEPTRE directly asking about the model numbers and they did validate it\u2019s basically the same TV the only difference being the way the legs mount.

The sound is fine, but if you're planning on using it for anything more than a bedroom you'll likely want a sound bar or other external speaker.

The only exception I have is when a person's face becomes unfocused and refocused in jerky motions, lasting only for a second or two when their heads move (during conversations). It may not be very noticeable to some, but I'm aware of it and find it a bit distracting. Of course it's more pronounced in zoom screen mode, but I can't see having a 32\" tv screen and watch programs in smaller proportions like panel. The full screen stretches the picture from side to side and doesn't look normal to me, and the same issue occurs. Otherwise I've very pleased with the quality of this product.

Full disclosure before I go into the review - getting this TV from Amazon was a huge drama.  There were shipping issues along with once I got the two 65\u201d models I ordered one of them had some dead pixels and some power management issues (turned off by itself).  Truth is, I did set it up to return both of these on the 10th of May and went with a single 65\u201d OLED instead.  That said, if I didn\u2019t get the OLED on sale I would have exchanged the defective model I got and bought another of these.  I didn\u2019t even open the second one I bought (was supposed to replace my 55\u201d OLED in the bedroom) because of the QA issues and drama I dealt with getting these shipped.  Amazon was WONDERFUL in their entire process and I can\u2019t thank their team enough for the hard work they did to get these to me as quickly as possible.  They also provided fantastic return service as well.  You may read this review and say, \u201cWell, why are you returning these then?!\u201d  I got a great deal on a 65\u201d OLED on eBay, brand new, so I couldn\u2019t pass it up.  I decided to keep the 55\u201d OLED in the bedroom and just get one 65\u201d OLED for the living room.  Bottom line is this - I posted an honest review below on AVSForum and wanted to share it with you guys that may be thinking about getting this TV.  In TL;DR fashion, the TV is fantastic if you keep your expectations realistic.  That said, here is my take on the TV and the review I wrote prior to deciding to ship these back and stick with OLED:", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": "\n      Size: 65 inches"}},

Personally, my priorities are picture quality and the overall aesthetic/look of the TV. Both of which are top notch considering the price point. I recently went through a defective Sony XBR49X900E with audio issues as well as the 2017 P-Series TCL (which also had an audio issue...go figure). Anyway, even though this resulted in me being TV-less for a couple weeks, I am very happy the delay allowed me the opportunity to pick up this 2018 model TCL. The picture quality feels like a refinement on the 2017 model (which was already great) and is right there or better than the Sony, which is impressive. I have a PS4 pro which looks unreal on this TV. Just amazing at this price point and  I sometimes have trouble pulling myself away because it all is so pleasing to look at. I am also much happier with the new \"brushed metal\" finish of this 2018 model. It just feels like a more premium product and looks much nicer in my living room. I really don't care about the voice recognition on the remote, but it seems to work well and I'm glad I have the option. Another note is the stand...I was at first disappointed because the new spacing of the legs on the TV are too wide for my recently purchased entertainment center. However, one of the answered questions here on Amazon recommended searching for a VESA mounted Pedestal stand. This completely solved my problem and I feel looks nicer and is more sturdy. I found one for around $30 on Amazon. Hope this info helps you pick your new TV!", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": "\n      Size: 55 inches"}},

Its picture quality puts that of my LG 43UH6500 to shame and demonstrates what I've been missing. First off, imagery on it is much more detailed relative to my 43UH6500, due to its larger screen and its traditional RGB sub-pixel structure (rather than the RGBw sub-pixel structure of the LG 43UH6500, in which a white sub-pixel is positioned in place of either a red, green, or blue sub-pixel for every third pixel, which means that even though it has a total of 3840 x 2160 pixels, it has less colored sub-pixels than 4K TVs with the traditional RGB sub-pixel layout and subsequently less vibrant colors and less detailed imagery). Furthermore and most importantly, the 55R617 produces much deeper blacks and has a much higher peak brightness - and can exhibit these two traits simultaneously due to its amazing contrast (thanks to its 96 dimming zones). Subsequently, day-time scenes are as bright as the day can be in real life, night-time scenes are realistically dark, and scenes which contain both dark elements and bright highlights really pop due to the TV's aforementioned amazing contrast.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": "\n      Size: 55 inches"}},

TV has a good over the air receiver and it has a very vivid and sharp picture.  I have used it for a little over 3 weeks.  I use it next to my bed.  It is in the back of the house and not facing any towers.  I live in Central NJ. Get more stations than I can shake a stick at.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

Full disclosure before I go into the review - getting this TV from Amazon was a huge drama.

Truth is, I did set it up to return both of these on the 10th of May and went with a single 65\u201d OLED instead.  That said, if I didn\u2019t get the OLED on sale I would have exchanged the defective model I got and bought another of these.  I didn\u2019t even open the second one I bought (was supposed to replace my 55\u201d OLED in the bedroom) because of the QA issues and drama I dealt with getting these shipped.  Amazon was WONDERFUL in their entire process and I can\u2019t thank their team enough for the hard work they did to get these to me as quickly as possible.  They also provided fantastic return service as well.  You may read this review and say, \u201cWell, why are you returning these then?!\u201d  I got a great deal on a 65\u201d OLED on eBay, brand new, so I couldn\u2019t pass it up.  I decided to keep the 55\u201d OLED in the bedroom and just get one 65\u201d OLED for the living room.  Bottom line is this - I posted an honest review below on AVSForum and wanted to share it with you guys that may be thinking about getting this TV.

Personally, my priorities are picture quality and the overall aesthetic/look of the TV. Both of which are top notch considering the price point.

Anyway, even though this resulted in me being TV-less for a couple weeks, I am very happy the delay allowed me the opportunity to pick up this 2018 model TCL. The picture quality feels like a refinement on the 2017 model (which was already great) and is right there or better than the Sony, which is impressive. I have a PS4 pro which looks unreal on this TV. Just amazing at this price point and  I sometimes have trouble pulling myself away because it all is so pleasing to look at. I am also much happier with the new \"brushed metal\" finish of this 2018 model. It just feels like a more premium product and looks much nicer in my living room. I really don't care about the voice recognition on the remote, but it seems to work well and I'm glad I have the option. Another note is the stand...I was at first disappointed because the new spacing of the legs on the TV are too wide for my recently purchased entertainment center. However, one of the answered questions here on Amazon recommended searching for a VESA mounted Pedestal stand. This completely solved my problem and I feel looks nicer and is more sturdy.

First off, imagery on it is much more detailed relative to my 43UH6500, due to its larger screen and its traditional RGB sub-pixel structure (rather than the RGBw sub-pixel structure of the LG 43UH6500, in which a white sub-pixel is positioned in place of either a red, green, or blue sub-pixel for every third pixel, which means that even though it has a total of 3840 x 2160 pixels, it has less colored sub-pixels than 4K TVs with the traditional RGB sub-pixel layout and subsequently less vibrant colors and less detailed imagery).

Subsequently, day-time scenes are as bright as the day can be in real life, night-time scenes are realistically dark, and scenes which contain both dark elements and bright highlights really pop due to the TV's aforementioned amazing contrast.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": "\n      Size: 55 inches"}},

I have my WiFi connection for the Roku channels, a Google Mi TV Box, a Chromecast unit and an Android TV Media Box with KODI app installed. It is fabulous! Just can't praise it enough. I do have one minor gripe .. the light on the front-bottom of the set that blinks to tell you when some command is being received from the remote. The only time this light turns OFF is when there is a picture on the screen or when  the set is unplugged. My usage is in the bedroom .. that is supposed to be dark at night. I do not want to get up and unplug the TV at the end of an evening's viewing. There needs to be a way to use the remote to turn this light OFF. (update: TCL has responded to this review and has solved this problem. The light goes off when the TV does. Success!

I do intend to mount it on the wall in the future but I think it would do fine on the legs. I like the settings menu, it jumps out from the side. You have several presets and can adjust all the usual settings: brightness etc. the sound is great, 10 is too loud. Pretty light as expected. The picture looks great, better than my Samsung, even on old Sanford and Son from the 70s! Connecting to Netflix and amazon is easy and QUICK and there are buttons for both. I don\u2019t use cable btw. Connecting to internet is easy. The menu jumps up from the bottom with all those apps and info as well. I\u2019m pretty impressed with the interface of this tv and I think LG has won me over from Samsung. My Samsung struggled with staying connected to Internet and Netflix etc was always freezing and dropping so I would have to turn it off and back on. I don\u2019t care for the remote it is small and seems cheap. Samsung makes a large remote that\u2019s easy to use and sturdy enough to smack someone with. I have big hands and this remote makes me feel like adre the giant. Bottom line I\u2019m very happy with the tv, I\u2019d buy it again and I\u2019m thinking about getting one for my parents.

The mounts for tabletop use work, but they are quite minimal. Sadly, this TV started having problems on the second day starting with purple vertical bars on the screen that progressed to multiple color bars ending in no picture or sound. I was on the phone for hours with LG trying to resolve it. Resets and power cycles did not resolve it (not surprisingly). LG's support service is lacking with their referral to non-participating service providers and unreachable providers.  After much insistence, my case was apparently escalated, and the issue was to be transferred to LG field support. I was adamantly assured I would be contacted soon on that day. I wasn't. This \"support\" is unacceptable for this product. The support representatives were friendly though, although the inference that this internal hardware issue might be physical damage as not appreciated (presumably as a way to escape support responsibility). It might otherwise be a good product, but with LG's failure to resolve the issue, I returned the TV and Amazon was good in that process.

The reflections on this is much less.  Delivered in good condition.  Easy setup.  First thing I did was to get wireless connected and run some YouTube screen test videos.  Zero edge light bleed, no banding, don't notice any dirty screen, haven't noticed any dead pixels..  Connected to the Comcast cable box, and to an OTA antenna.  Scanned for the OTA channels.

The reflections on this is much less.  Delivered in good condition.  Easy setup.  First thing I did was to get wireless connected and run some YouTube screen test videos.  Zero edge light bleed, no banding, don't notice any dirty screen, haven't noticed any dead pixels..  Connected to the Comcast cable box, and to an OTA antenna.  Scanned for the OTA channels.  OTA looks great.  Tweaked the picture settings as follows:", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": "\n      Size: 55-Inch"}},

Other than that, picture is great, sound is great, Roku features work great as well and price was super attractive.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": "\n      Size: 43 inches"}},

Thankfully there's Amazon's customer service 'cause TCL's is dismal. Buyer beware if you need to contact TCL support. I bought the unit just under a month ago. It worked fine for two weeks. After two weeks, it would turn on and appear okay, but after a few minutes you'd hear a hum/buzz that would get louder over a few minutes, then the video would go blank. Audio still worked, but no video and no pressing of any mouse buttons would bring it back. Unplugging and immediately replugging wouldn't help either. But unplugging for an hour and turning it on worked, only the problem would happen again. It was sort of like something tried to warm up and when it did, it just died. I tried all factory reset options... tried reseting via the button on the side. The sound before the video went out was from the back of the unit, not the speakers and was unaffected by speaker volume. I initially tried to replace it with Amazon but they were out of stock so I started a return process (since you only have 30 days on devices like this). With the return started just in case, I reached out to TCL. They are slow. The send duplicate emails. They take days to reply. They do not communicate well. Despite sending the serial number and proof of purchase, they wanted a picture of the serial number and a video of the problem (hard to upload a 3 minute video from a phone when their website limits uploads to 10Mb). After 10 days of back and forth and with only 3 days left to return it to Amazon, they finally called me. They wanted to send out a tech in another 7-10 days to repair it. If the tech couldn't repair it, then they wanted to send a tech with a replacement after that (another 1-2 weeks). I offered to give them my CC to secure it and asked to ship a replacement and I would return the old one, but they said they cannot do that. I work and can't wait for a tech to come to my home to do a repair for hours and possibly have to return again. Plus it would be another week to three weeks before I'd have a working TV... which would be too late to return it to Amazon and would now be an item with used, replacement parts in it... this for something I'd had less than a month. I've seen some good reviews for these and some bad ones. I understand tech fails. But its the TCL technical support that really failed here. In the end, I saw Amazon had these in stock again... so I cancelled the return, and redid it as an exchange. New TV will be here in 48 hours and I have 30 days to return the bad one to Amazon. No waiting 7-10 days for a tech... and 1-2 weeks for a new unit if repairs can't be done. I just put the bad one into the replacement ones box and drop it off at UPS.

I have 2 other 32\" and 1 43' and a 49', lets hope they keep playing.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": "\n      Size: 32 inches"}},

SCAM ALERT  I did run into a situation and I want to warn others about it.  When I was setting up Roku, I could not get it to activate and it gave me the number of Roku support to call.  I phoned and was told by a Jerry Maxwell I would need to purchase a license.  There was a standard for 3 years 3 device for $79.00 or a deluxe licence  for 5 years unlimited devices (don't have cost).  I was angry that I had to pay 79.00 for Roku since I had a Roku stick already but I thought what the hell I want Roku.  I told the guy this is bull****!.  He said he would call back.  In the meantime I tried activating through my roku account and it went through!  So maybe Jerry did something but when he called back, I said it's working and I 'm not paying $79.00!  He hung up.

It is terrific for my purpose. Surprisingly great picture quality. I am not using a cable, satellite or antenna feed of any kind. I have my WiFi connection for the Roku channels, a Google Mi TV Box, a Chromecast unit and an Android TV Media Box with KODI app installed. It is fabulous! Just can't praise it enough. I do have one minor gripe .. the light on the front-bottom of the set that blinks to tell you when some command is being received from the remote. The only time this light turns OFF is when there is a picture on the screen or when  the set is unplugged. My usage is in the bedroom .. that is supposed to be dark at night. I do not want to get up and unplug the TV at the end of an evening's viewing. There needs to be a way to use the remote to turn this light OFF. (update: TCL has responded to this review and has solved this problem. The light goes off when the TV does. Success! Thank You TCL.)", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": "\n      Size: 32 inches"}},

I went over all the connections and double and triple-checked them.  They were all fine and as should be.  I finally hooked up my previous TV and everything is fine and I have to return this TV.  Thank heavens for Amazon Prime.  I don't know what you call the thing that replaces the picture tube in these new TVs but I guess this one failed completely after about an hour.

You can't turn even turn it off or on.  Second, my GF does not like the small remote control.  I don't see it as an issue, but she does. Those are my only issues though.
