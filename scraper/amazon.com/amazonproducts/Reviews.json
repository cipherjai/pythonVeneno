The only time this light turns OFF is when there is a picture on the screen or when  the set is unplugged. My usage is in the bedroom .. that is supposed to be dark at night. I do not want to get up and unplug the TV at the end of an evening's viewing. There needs to be a way to use the remote to turn this light OFF.
