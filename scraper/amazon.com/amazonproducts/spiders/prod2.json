Since it is newer (and it's 4K instead of 1080p like the other one), the processing and memory are much larger and faster. Loads everything effortlessly and always gives a great viewing experience. As for the actual visuals (it is a TV, after all), the picture is fantastic and vibrant. I'll admit that I have very little experience with 4K televisions, but I will say that it appears to be successfully upconverting everything we play though it quite nicely without any visible ghosting that I can tell from my normal sitting position.

Also, the Ine Connect has constant handshake issues with the Fire TV which takes repeated disconnect/reconnect of the one connect cord to recognize the device. Both companies blame each other, but I use this 4K Fire TV on other TVs in my home without any issues. I have DirecTV and use the RVU app which acts as a set top box client on this TV instead of getting another box, but limited remote buttons for this TV makes it a challenge to do simple things like no previous channel button or you have to go thru steps just to manually enter a channel number. Overall, I like the picture but feels it falls well short of other smarTVs like my 75\u201d Sony.", "verification": null, "product_type": null}},

Initially the tv was great, the picture was amazing and everything was flawless. Within the 1st year I had to have my 1 connect box (I think that's what it's called) that connects all your HDMI inputs into 1 main box, replaced. Then at 15 months into buying my $1000 tv it went into \"Boot Loop\" in which it constantly turns itself on and off. We couldn't get a picture, only the occasional 1 sec of sound before it shut down again. I purchased an extended warranty and contacted Geek Squad and he knew it was the main board immediately and said \"Typical Samsung\". Luckily they will fix it for free. After Googleing Samsung TV boot loop and seeing the THOUSANDS of people having this issue just after Samsung's warranty expires, I would say this is a HUGE problem with them. I have seen where many who have had their main boards replaced, have had the same boot mode issue happen within weeks to a year after replacing the board. Luckily my warranty has a clause that if they have to fix it 3x, you get to pick out a new tv at the purchase price of your original. Call me old fashioned but I feel when you spend this kind of money for a tv, it should last more than 15", "verification": null, "product_type": null}},

Also, the design is sleek and slim. It is the perfect addition to any TV watching room - it's the jewel of the room. The next aspect that surprised me was the sharpness and pure colors that the TV projected. I anticipated a TV of this size would not have such clear, succinct colors. It really enhanced each and every program I watched. I especially loved watching game shows, movies and reality shows on the NU7100 - they were \"larger than life\"! My family and friends love coming over to watch TV at my house now - they love the TV! Another amazing aspect is the smart functions. They are so convenient and easy to use. No more searching - everything is right in front of you! Not only are they easily accessible, you have access to any smart function you can imagine or need. I love that I can toggle between cable, Netflix, Amazon Video, etc. with just a few clicks on the remote. Overall, I am completely amazed with the Samsung 65\" NU7100!

THe remote that comes with this smart TV is NICELY simple!  I was more concerned about this TV having a rumble like young people go for, as that would just make the words impossible to understand. Anyway, it is clear as a bell, and other than the fact that if you prefer head banger sound, you probably wouldn't get a thumpy bass out of it, (thank GOD) what more can you ask for?  I have it sitting on about 45% volume and can hear it clearly in other rooms. Oh, the oddest thing is that if you want to see closed captioning (a MUST for us) on Netflix, you have to DE-select captioning on \"\u00e4lways\" and instead select captioning  \"on mute only\" and you'll get the captions. While it's NOT on mute. HAHAHA. Took me a while to figure that one out, and only after unplugging everything etc. I wouldn't have even TRIED it on that setting except that it HAD been working before, so I was going through every possibility in case its computer had gotten stuck.

The warranty I purchased was excellent as well (SmartGuard). They provided me with an exact same make and model TV, which ALSO arrived with a broken screen.

With the actual TV and its performance, I do sincerely really like it.  I want to recommend you buy it but I wouldn't buy anything these days without the warranty.  In the last two years I've not purchased an electronic device that has not failed after the initial warranty expired. So, I'm not sure I would say this is a bad TV just a bad trend in electronics manufacture.  This TV originally replaced a Samsung TV that lasted barely a year.  I'm no longer hesitate to buy brands I've never heard of because they are less expensive.  They work as well or better than I expected and broke down at the same rate as \"name brand\" products.

To me, nothing over 40\" is necessary for our living room. To her, nothing over 32\". This TV fit the bill perfectly, at least in size. The tiny bezel was perfect! It's pretty much the exact same size as our old TV! So we both win! My only gripe is with Roku. It is SLOOOOOW! It takes forever to turn on, forever to switch apps and forever to connect, forever to do pretty much anything. There's also some major lag between pressing buttons and the TV reacting. And it only seems to get worse as time goes by. We have this connected to an HTPC, and Ruko has taken much of the load off the PC, but sometimes its sluggishness is just too much to deal with. Another annoyance is the remote, it's got a really weird line of sight. We sit about 7 feet away from the screen and you have to hold it up and aim it at a weird angle for the TV to respond (there's nothing in between us and the TV). It would be nice if I could get our Harmony remote to work with this TV, but there doesn't seem to be a way to do it. I've tried everything, but no go. It's not TCL's fault. It's Logitech.

There are plenty of great applications, and I keep Netflix, Hulu, and Prime video at the top of my homepage. However, it seems that you get what you pay for in processing power, and these issues have become more apparent as time goes on. My unit is situated about two feet from my router with high speed internet. In the beginning, streaming through the Netflix or Hulu app was lightning quick. However, a few weeks ago, my unit began experiencing severe slowdowns. The menu was lagging, apps were taking minutes to open, and the TV wouldn't even shut off after the power button was pressed. These issues weren't associated with my internet connection, but with the operation of the Roku OS. After these slowdowns began, video streaming was absolutely crippled. I am unable to watch any media through Netflix, Hulu, Prime video, or Acorn, as they will just buffer indefinitely. Streaming is still perfect on a laptop or phone in the same vicinity, but the television just can't handle it. After resetting the television, wifi, and any other possible factors, I've come to accept that the \"smart\" aspect of this set is irrevocably damaged.

The 2016 model had everything crunched up in the back in one spot making access to wires or hangin a little difficult. The new tv which I purchased came in 2 days right on the dot, it is the 2017 model they moved all the HDMI ports to the left of the tv and put the ac input(power) cable on the right side to reduce clutter which I'm very fond of. Amazon if you see this I hope you are. Because I'm one satisfied Customer.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

For some reason, the geniuses at Sumsung left out the ability to get to all the color settings in custom mode, but available only when in HDR.  I actually thought the whole intention of having an HDR+ mode was to not have to adjust the colors.  So why they offer them on in HDR+ mode, and not in the custom mode, I have no idea. And these settings do no good in HDR+ because it just tunes the colors all wrong (maybe the panel isn't tune for the US set?). So with no ability to set the white balance, and other color levels (not talking about the Red and Green slide setting) the colors cannot be adjusted (especially the greens). So you cannot get good flesh tones right, or light tans. Faces are too white, or too magenta. While the pictures looks great in the store, once you get past the big picture, and the soap opera motion, the tv just don't make a compelling reason to get it over my old set.  I will probably just send it back and keep my 9 year till it blows up (well, hopefully it will last just long enough to let me tune my next tv's color to its high standards).", "verification": null, "product_type": null}},

It's 4k HDR, so you get the full array of saturated colors that are typical of high dynamic range. That doesn't apply only to HDR compatible games and movies, because even standard 4k and 1080p colors are rich and vibrant. The cord hiding feature is also amazing. There are channels leading to all of the inputs on the back of the TV, which in turn runs into the base itself, so all of your cords aren't actually exposed until they exit out of the back of the TV stand. The remote is also streamlined and good quality, with rubberized buttons and voice control. The bezel on this TV is also extremely thin, much like a smartphone bezel. Setup was an absolute breeze, with full on-screen commands and ethereal background music to guide you through smoothly and quickly.

Smart TV functions have everything I need for a basic core experience but a few more apps and channels would be really great.

The remote is wonderfully sleek, easy to use, has impressive around-the-corner range and it's only drawback is accidentally sitting on it has taken me far from where I was watching in a split second, much to the great confusion of all watching. It was super easy to set up, both physically and digitally and takes up very little footprint compared to my old tv.

Ive owned 5 different samsung tvs all have have been great quality. This one is different.... After about 2 weeks it began making a ticking noise from the back. Usually happens at least three times a minute. At first I gave it the benefit of the doubt thinking it was just the expansion and contraction of parts warming and cooling. Or possibly The plastic on the rear creeking from being wall mounted. It is none of the above this is an audible distraction coming from inside the tv. Soo I ended up having Samsung come out to look at it. The tech heard the noise ended up having to order an entire new screen and two of the main boards. Which in just parts cost more than if they just gave me a new tv or my money back. After he replaced everything the day I got home mind you my wife has had to leave work early twice now because they only come out between 8am and 5pm monday to friday the tv is still making the clicking noise. So I called up they want to come out again to check the noise. So again my wife has to be home to have them come see it at a loss of wages to us again. The tech doesnt hear this time but ive recorded the noise and have had friends over that have heard it after all the parts were replaced. So being that the tech didnt hear it when he came out there is nothing they can do no refund nothing. After all the years ive bought Samsung products im done ive owned 5 tvs none of which do I have these issues with, 4 phones, 1 sound bar, 1 surround sound system 3 blueray players, 1 microwave and 1 dishwasher. Im done good job loosing a valued life time customer I wont buy a thing from you again. My next phone wont be manufactured by you along with every other electronic or appliance I ever own.

My family and friends love coming over to watch TV at my house now - they love the TV! Another amazing aspect is the smart functions. They are so convenient and easy to use. No more searching - everything is right in front of you! Not only are they easily accessible, you have access to any smart function you can imagine or need.

It was relatively unassuming, however, once I noticed it, I couldn't stop looking at it in nearly every lightly-colored scene. I thought at first, it might be possibly due to Rogue One's rendering, so I turned on World War II in Color on Netflix.... same thing. The picture I've attached to this review shows a paused overcast sky from WW2 in Color, and I tried to point out the line (the other uniform lines are simply artifacts of my phone) with arrows. It looks minor in the image, but once I saw it, I couldn't \"unsee\" it. It was really noticeable at night when my living room was dark.

Secondly, the streaming feature works well for a short period of time but after awhile. Basically, you lose the ability to view movies, tv shows, etc. We had to start removing and adding back the wi-fi to get streaming apps to work. It has something to do with the communication of the GEO locators between the streaming companies and TCL. Supposedly, there is a fix in the works but it may be awhile.

I've had the TV for little over two weeks now, and I have to say that I'm pretty impressed. The picture quality straight out of the box isn't the best, with way too much oversaturated colors and an ugly level of sharpness. But when calibrated (Roku TVs don't have a lot of settings particular to picture quality, and the more advanced settings like white balance and gamma are reserved to the companion app) it looks pretty stunning. I've had no issues with the TV in terms of shipping management, nothing damaged or otherwise defective. The only downside is that there is substantial backlight bleed on the edges of the screen but it isn't obtrusive and it's something that can easily be gotten used to. I also want to talk about the Roku elements of the TV. Everything works well, there's no visible hiccups and there is no remote lag (although it's extremely particular as to where you aim the remote) which compared to my last Smart TV, is pretty great. I do have one gripe with the Roku apps though, with Netflix in particular. Many of the apps look to be running at a pretty low resolution and look relatively ugly with even highly compressed thumbnails. Even the subtitles in Netflix are pretty aliased. This isn't a big problem though, as it's only a nitpick. Despite this, the apps that I've tested for 4K streaming, Netflix, Hulu, and Vudu are all fully capable of streaming 4K, which the TV itself handles well.

Really?) but recently my theme was mysteriously changed to a Game of Thrones theme which isn't even in the theme store so it couldn't have been me or anyone else. Additionally, there's always an advertisement on the right side of the screen on the home page, and you can guess what it was advertising when my theme was magically changed. That being said, the quality and size of the screen is outstanding, and the personalization settings are very convenient. Overall it's a good deal, though I don't agree that Roku is a cable box replacement.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

I've noticed some people have had issues with the 120hz output as I think that is simulated and not actually 120hz. 60hz is completely supported and looks fantastic paired with a PS4 Pro, Xbox One S or X, or a gaming PC. The star of the show here though is the Roku interface. This is what really makes this TV shine. It is turns on fast, operates very smoothly, and just works without any major issues. I have a Samsung SU8000 series Smart TV. I can say without a doubt that the TCL's Roku interface beats the Samsung's smart interface by a mile. The programmers of this Roku interface did an amazing job as it supports 4k HDR streaming flawlessly, and little touches like being able to change the theme of your TV really go a long way for the user experience.

I am going to give this TV 5 stars for now. But I've only had it for a month so I can't comment on long-term durability/dependability. I am stunned by the value here. For the price, I was ready to be disappointed, but this is a really first class user experience. I did not try to mount my TV. I just used the included legs to put it on my entertainment console. Set up was a breeze....much easier than the more expensive brand-name sets I have owned. The illumination seems even and is sufficiently bright. I am not an expert on black levels, etc. The blacks look black to me, and the picture in general is as good as my other set from a a better known brand (which cost $1500). I really like the integration of streaming services. I know other brands do this, but TCL has done a great job. With the exception of Apple TV, I have all of my services in one place.....and I could of course add Apple TV as an external device. Kudos to TCL for whatever they are doing.....jamming this much goodness into their sets at a great price.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

If you notice, the sensor is a flat pice of clear plastic under the TCL label.  For whatever reason, the sensor doesn't pick up the IR too well when the remote is aimed from an angle in front of the set.  Knowing that IR reflects off of aluminum foil quite well, you can do so mething to fix this problem.  Just form some foil around a bent piece of cardboard, and place it under and a little behind the sensor.  You should notice a dramatic improvement - no more missed button presses.  If you are mounting the TV on a wall, you could try taping a piece of foil just behind the sensor - let it hang down & curl the bottom toward you a bit so some of the IR bounces up into the sensor.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

I had to perform a complete factory reset twice to fix the issue (when you perform a factory reset, it completely erases ALL settings, including subscription services, like YouTube, Netflix, etc.) A massive pain, but I still love this TV. Excellent picture quality, decent sound, and I love the \"smart\" aspects. It's just such a shame that their customer service is basically non-existent.

I don't write reviews often but this TV deserves it. It's the summer 2017 model so it has HDR now which gives you a more vibrant, dynamic color range as well as better black levels. I've used it for about a week now and TV shows like Gotham do a great job showing how well the HDR handles dark scenes. I've played upscaled PS3 games, PS4 games at 1080p look stunning, I look forward to trying an Xbox One X on it. My only complaint is that the 4K videos on Youtube can supposedly work but if I bring up the \"Stats for Nerds\" it shows that Optimal Resolution is 3840x2160 but the best it'll stream at is 1920x1080 even with a full 60 seconds of buffer. I'm only on 20 meg DSL but with that good of a buffer the 4K should work. Any help on that TCL? As far as picture quality, it's fantastic. I've seen models for double the price that aren't much better. The text is so sharp, I can't see individual pixels even from my 3 foot viewing distance in bed. Brightness levels are very high, I had to put it in Dark mode for nighttime viewing. Colors are very vibrant and can be customized, I dropped the Contrast and Saturation from 100 to 90 and like that look.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

This is my first big, flat screen, smart TV and I couldn't be happier! I spent some time learning what I should look for in this up grade. I then compared prices at Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon. I found Amazon Prime with free shipping to be the best price. I had been using a ROKU with my old TV so I was familiar with working with it. It arrived at my door and it was heavy but not too heavy for this under 5 ft. 60 year old woman. I gently scooted it across the floor to where I wanted it. I was able to tip the box and slid the TV out and could handle it easily from there. Once I had it plugged in, it did most everything itself!! Picture quality is excellent and the 55 in size was perfect for my room size and I can be in the kitchen and watch it too. Sound is just that. If you want something theater quality you will have to buy a sound system. I am using a 2006 3-2-1 Bose. You just use a cable with red & yellow connector (with a headphone jack on the other end) that goes to the Bose and plug that into your headphone jack in the TV! My Bose does not have HDMI. I was very impressed with the ease of setting up, the price, and the quality of this TV. I have had it now for close to 4 weeks. I do not anticipate any problems but will post them if they arise. I am also impressed with the remote for this TV. Very simple. Also in the ease of access to ROKU and AMAZON channels. Once you set up your account you can buy or rent movies, series, and channels right thru your amazon prime with ease. I would not hesitate for one minute to buy this TV again.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}}
