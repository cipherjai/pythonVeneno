I needed a new bedroom TV that had smart functions such as hulu and Netflix, and Playstation Vue, so having roku built in was going to be very convenient.  The setup was easy, just attach the legs to the bottom of the TV with 2 screws each.  It is a bit wobbly if pushed, but it seems sturdy enough.  Setting up the TV itself was fast, it does ask you to connect or setup your Roku account, which took just a few mins.  It will even ask you to plug in your existing equipment (cable box, game systems, amazon fire tv, etc) into the HDMI ports and allow you to tell it what each hdmi port has connected.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

The first one that came had a cracked screen and Amazon replaced it immediately! (thanks!). This TV (55\") is really huge and the picture quality in my honest opinion is very clear. Please note if you use cable, I noticed yesterday when trying the cable channels, almost all the channels are HD 1080. So you may not see any difference in the picture quality (except that the screen might be much larger) in the cable channels (e.g., CNNHD). But, there are many movies and also Youtube clips that are in 4K and you can really enjoy them. What I noticed is that even 1080 provides a good quality for my eyes. I could hardly notice if a picture is 1080 or 4K, but I can tell you the 4K quality seemed just to be very real. Given the largeness of the screen, you could think you were there in person (something you can't possibly feel with 1080). The Ruko environment is wonderfully easy (I already had a Roku account from the past). For its price, I think this TV is a bargain. Overall, my previous TV (LG 42\" 3D HD) was already really good so I was in doubt whether paying an extra $400+ (price and tax) would justify, but now I can see it was worth. It's like having a small-scale movie theatre in your home. Lastly, I read among the reviews (before buying the TV) that some people had complained about the TV's speaker (so I had thought I needed also to buy a separate speaker!). Honestly, I find the speakers really awesome! I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about. I agree it is not the best speaker you may see, but I find the sound quality and volume to be really good (note: I am only an ordinary use, not a tech savvy who can distinguish microscopic differences). Overall, if you are looking for a 4K TV and not very expensive, I strongly recommend that look at this TV very closely before considering anything else. I have found it a really good TV.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

Over two weeks of use, we had 3-4 complete television freezes, resulting in several resets. Again, no big deal. What ruined this television for us was the loud pop from the television one day, seems like it broke and would not come on.

They were only a delivery service, an 82\u201d TV was sent out with no setup. You can\u2019t unbox something this size, you cut the box away. It took an hour or so to set it up solo and get on it the stand without overstressing the unit. In the end it worked out.

Heavier than I expected but it IS a 55\". Great picture quality and great features. The only gripe I have, which others may have mentioned is the power cord. Samsung what are you doing? The power cord is shorter then most cords AND with their wire management system it's impossible to use if you don't have an outlet directly behind the TV. Great for wall-mounting but most TVs sit on a stand. We had to opt not to use their wire management built in. Our TV is going on a swivel stand but even still, the cord is going to be shorter then it needs to be. Big downfall there on Samsungs part with the short cord. I'm not taking a star off for that but heads up folks. Still an awesome TV and i'd buy it again. The remote is interesting. I have the best/smartest Harmony remote already but am simplifying things and planning to just use their One Remote. I wish they added a few more buttons on the remote for cable boxes (GUIDE BUTTON!) but it's sleek/small and does the job.

I stay over on weekends sometimes and I had the option of either watching something that someone else in the house was watching, or squinting over a small laptop screen while watching movies in the guest bed.  Both those options got old real quick, I was low on funds due to pricey Christmas purchases and wanted something of an average size, and for less than $200.  All I was finding were subpar brands I had never heard of, but I continued looking and my perseverance paid off when I found this Samsung TV that met all my requirements.  It was of the great quality and performance I have come to expect from Samsung televisions.  Setting it up was easy, not to mention, how light it was.  I lifted it by myself, set it on the bed, inserted the feet, and put it on the cabinet.  I own two Samsung TVs at my condo, both are LCDs, but weigh significantly more than this one (they are also over 10 years old and work flawlessly, a testament to the quality of Samsung electronics).  The image on this TV is sharp, colors are beautiful, and best of all, it was extremely affordable, and a brand new 2017 model (I bought it in 2017, so having a brand new model, rather than something a year or two old, was awesome).  Does the job, and very well! By the way, my mother bought herself a Toshiba which would not play anything off a thumb drive.  This TV cost me less than her Toshiba and will open and play thumb drives, for those wondering.  I also connected my Fire Stick and it works great.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

One of the few things I've been slightly bothered is the sound quality. I'm going to have to buy a sound bar or some other kind of speaker set because the TV speakers aren't great and I've had to have it turned nearly all the way up with majority of the things I watch. Otherwise it's been pretty awesome. The only reason I'm not giving picture quality 5-stars is because it's been glitching a bit; it could be due to Comcast, but it's still 50/50...I'll update later if that changes. It's definitely a light weight TV, however once you've placed it on whatever surface you're using it's kind of difficult to maneuver it around. It can be a bit wobbly, just trying to pick it up to adjust it the base can feel a little unstable and make the TV feel slightly top heavy.

I had a 15 year old Samsung DLP, but not just a DLP, it was the best DLP ever made. No light bulbs, no spinning mirrors, no moving parts. After 12 or 13 years, it started getting white spots, so I  replaced the DLP chip myself and it was great again until the remote, and switches would not respond, So in comes the 65\" LG, this is the biggest I've bought so far, the others were 62\", and a little smaller. This one is big in the bedroom, it's like being at a drive-in. The color is good, nothing blares out to me in the picture that I could complain about. I should tell you that I know  what a good picture should look like, and there are a lot of bad TV out there. The LG has a setup that it takes you through to set it up, that was OK.  I got rid of DirecTV, and use DirecTVNow through a 4k FireTV box, and it works really well, and cut my TV bill by 75% . You do have to have Internet to get DirecTVNow, it is a streaming service, but it works really well for me. They gave me 125 channels, and HBO for $55 a month, plus I can record.  It's all new, and so far, so good. The LG looked really good on my FireTV, and  DirecTVNow, which is an app on the FireTV.  I did buy a sound bar with a floor standing woofer, but to be honest, the LG was the first really flat Tv to have decent sound. The sound bar and woofer were a bit better, but not so much that I would cry if I didn't have it. It was a Vizio soundbar I bought in a local club store. The TV box came double boxed by Fedex, and the Fedex guy brought it inside, but wanted to leave it outside and make me bring it in. The TV is light, and you have to put legs on it. each leg takes three screws, and they are labeled A and B, so pay attention, or the Tv might be tipsy on you if you put them on backwards.  This TV was bought with a 4 year warranty, yes, it cost a little more, but read the details,  they fix it in your home, and if they can't fix it they refund your money, how can you beat that. I keep all my electronics on a UPS  battery backup. I live in the lightning belt, and lightening will kill a TV, and many other electronics things very easily. Worse than that, it can cause a hard to find problem, one that many TV repair shops might have trouble fixing. It can even cause multiple problems, making it even harder to fix. I have been on UPS battery backup for 20 years, and yes , I have to replace batteries, and and in some cases I had to replace the UPS, that is way better than having all sorts of problems with my TV's, and other electronics stuff. This LG Tv is a bargain, it is a 2018 model, and supports Google Home, and Amazon Alesis . It has bluetooth to connect to a  bluetooth sound bar.. So let me share my experience in the local club store when I bought the sound bar.  I asked if any of them come with wire connections to the TV , as well as Bluetooth.  I worked in electronics my whole life, and I would rather use wire. In any case, he said no, they all use bluetooth, no wire. So I get it home and open the box and there is an optical cable, a 3,5mm cable, and one other cable, so there was 4 ways to connect that sound bar to my TV, not just Bluetooth. So  I used the Toslink optical cable to connect the sound bar, but now, about the TV and the sound bar. I had the center channel working on the optical cable, and before that I had it on the 3.5mm wire to my cell phone to hear what it sounded like. When the TV came on it dropped the woofer, which does connect with Bluetooth to the sound bar.  So I turned the TV off, and back on, and that was all it needed,  all the sound came on as it should. No hassle, it just did its thing and worked. Their are a lot of apps in this TV, so if you are not fortunate enough to have FireTv with a Prime account, which is awesome, and I highly recommend it, the Tv has a lot of other streaming services built into it.  One of them is Amazon, but that way of getting Amazon content, in no way compares to FireTV, but there are many other apps also.. You can also plus a USB thumb drive , or maybe even a usb hard drive into the back of the TV and watch video, pictures and music from it, It works really well. Then there are plenty of HDMI connectors, although I only needed one.  The remote does leave a little room to complain, the buttons could have been bigger, especially the ones you would use in the dark. Ok, I can replace the remote with a programmable touch screen, but why should i need to do that? Are you reading this LG, get with it , make a great remote for this great TV.  You should be able to get 12 to 14, or more feet from a screen this big,  Some people get lemons, some people don't know what a good picture is, and some people just like to complain, try to know the difference when you read reviews.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": "\n      Size: 65-inch"}},

I was a little concerned about setting it up with the TV provider when have, but that was NOT a problem. This is the first smart TV I've owned, and now I know why they're called 'smart'. It practically sets itself up! The default setting has a VERY annoying female voice that guides you through all the set-up. It wouldn't be so bad other than for the fact that she talks so fast you can barely understand her. It's easy to disable that in settings. I like every feature of this TV and highly recommend it if you're in the market for a smart TV. The price is hard to believe for what you get.

I had a 15 year old Samsung DLP, but not just a DLP, it was the best DLP ever made. No light bulbs, no spinning mirrors, no moving parts. After 12 or 13 years, it started getting white spots, so I  replaced the DLP chip myself and it was great again until the remote, and switches would not respond, So in comes the 65\" LG, this is the biggest I've bought so far, the others were 62\", and a little smaller. This one is big in the bedroom, it's like being at a drive-in. The color is good, nothing blares out to me in the picture that I could complain about. I should tell you that I know  what a good picture should look like, and there are a lot of bad TV out there. The LG has a setup that it takes you through to set it up, that was OK.  I got rid of DirecTV, and use DirecTVNow through a 4k FireTV box, and it works really well, and cut my TV bill by 75% . You do have to have Internet to get DirecTVNow, it is a streaming service, but it works really well for me. They gave me 125 channels, and HBO for $55 a month, plus I can record.  It's all new, and so far, so good. The LG looked really good on my FireTV, and  DirecTVNow, which is an app on the FireTV.  I did buy a sound bar with a floor standing woofer, but to be honest, the LG was the first really flat Tv to have decent sound. The sound bar and woofer were a bit better, but not so much that I would cry if I didn't have it. It was a Vizio soundbar I bought in a local club store. The TV box came double boxed by Fedex, and the Fedex guy brought it inside, but wanted to leave it outside and make me bring it in. The TV is light, and you have to put legs on it. each leg takes three screws, and they are labeled A and B, so pay attention, or the Tv might be tipsy on you if you put them on backwards.  This TV was bought with a 4 year warranty, yes, it cost a little more, but read the details,  they fix it in your home, and if they can't fix it they refund your money, how can you beat that. I keep all my electronics on a UPS  battery backup. I live in the lightning belt, and lightening will kill a TV, and many other electronics things very easily. Worse than that, it can cause a hard to find problem, one that many TV repair shops might have trouble fixing. It can even cause multiple problems, making it even harder to fix. I have been on UPS battery backup for 20 years, and yes , I have to replace batteries, and and in some cases I had to replace the UPS, that is way better than having all sorts of problems with my TV's, and other electronics stuff. This LG Tv is a bargain, it is a 2018 model, and supports Google Home, and Amazon Alesis . It has bluetooth to connect to a  bluetooth sound bar.. So let me share my experience in the local club store when I bought the sound bar.  I asked if any of them come with wire connections to the TV , as well as Bluetooth.  I worked in electronics my whole life, and I would rather use wire. In any case, he said no, they all use bluetooth, no wire. So I get it home and open the box and there is an optical cable, a 3,5mm cable, and one other cable, so there was 4 ways to connect that sound bar to my TV, not just Bluetooth. So  I used the Toslink optical cable to connect the sound bar, but now, about the TV and the sound bar. I had the center channel working on the optical cable, and before that I had it on the 3.5mm wire to my cell phone to hear what it sounded like. When the TV came on it dropped the woofer, which does connect with Bluetooth to the sound bar.  So I turned the TV off, and back on, and that was all it needed,  all the sound came on as it should. No hassle, it just did its thing and worked. Their are a lot of apps in this TV, so if you are not fortunate enough to have FireTv with a Prime account, which is awesome, and I highly recommend it, the Tv has a lot of other streaming services built into it.  One of them is Amazon, but that way of getting Amazon content, in no way compares to FireTV, but there are many other apps also.. You can also plus a USB thumb drive , or maybe even a usb hard drive into the back of the TV and watch video, pictures and music from it, It works really well. Then there are plenty of HDMI connectors, although I only needed one.  The remote does leave a little room to complain, the buttons could have been bigger, especially the ones you would use in the dark. Ok, I can replace the remote with a programmable touch screen, but why should i need to do that? Are you reading this LG, get with it , make a great remote for this great TV.  You should be able to get 12 to 14, or more feet from a screen this big,  Some people get lemons, some people don't know what a good picture is, and some people just like to complain, try to know the difference when you read reviews.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

I was a little concerned about setting it up with the TV provider when have, but that was NOT a problem. This is the first smart TV I've owned, and now I know why they're called 'smart'. It practically sets itself up! The default setting has a VERY annoying female voice that guides you through all the set-up. It wouldn't be so bad other than for the fact that she talks so fast you can barely understand her. It's easy to disable that in settings. I like every feature of this TV and highly recommend it if you're in the market for a smart TV. The price is hard to believe for what you get.

My first HDTV was a Vizio 42 inch 1080p that i bought almost 5 years ago after high school. It looked great. I Paid $420 for it. I thought i got a pretty good deal on it. Fast forward to 2018 and 4k is still settling in and technology is moving forward. I was at work during Prime week and the website was terribly slow but i still wanted to see what they had in stock. I stumbled across this TV as i was going to be in the market for one during the holiday season 2018. When i found this TV, I was shocked at how much it was! $280! For a 50 inch 4k Fire TV with Alex built in, That's almost half the cost of my old vizio. I thought it was too good to be true. Reviews were mixed but i wanted to take a stab at it anyways. I ordered it and it was here 3 days later. My initial impressions were \"eh\". Setup was a breeze but there was more than that i had noticed. I decided on comparing it with my vizio with some Good Mythical Morning on YouTube. I Know it's compressed video but it was the best i had to work with at first. I watched one episode and I was kind of Disappointed. The Brightness was good but the color was kind of dull overall and over saturated on some parts of the image like a person's face, but i wasn't giving up there. Setting the TV's Picture color setting from default to natural completely changed the game. The Color was great! Everything seemed correct with pulling up a color correction test on YouTube and it looked great! The Speakers were OK but that doesn't bother me because i have a dedicated 5.1 Surround System that blows the socks on the TV speakers. I really wanted a bigger size TV overall since the 42 inch wasn't quite the size I wanted. The 50 Inch was the perfect size for my TV stand and it matched the room which is a pretty small living room but it worked just fine. Now it's $400 and i still think it's a good deal considering my 42 inch was $20 more. I run the TV 1080p still because my laptop does not output 4k but It still looks great. The Fire TV portion is good for what it offers. More Ad's than I liked but for the value, No big deal. The 4k Netflix Shows look great. HDR Looks really good. The only downside to this TV for me is when i'm playing Dolby Digital through any apps on the smart portion of the TV, the volume seems to fluctuate. I'm sure this can be fixed with a software update but It's what i experienced. I would give it a go if you're interested in getting a good TV for the Money and hey if It doesn't work out, 30 Day Return!", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

People are so caught up on 4K.. HDR (High Dynamic Range) make a better difference to the eye than 4K (Google it). Now there are two types of HDR, some have both but this one has HDR10 which is the endustry standard (Dolby Vision HDR is better but not as popular and barely can tell a difference). Let me say I was so worried that this TV would ship and I would be upset. This was not the case... the TV comes with Roku (a value in itself) and a very user friendly remote. Some people complain about the viewing angles and sound but to be honest - I really don't think it's bad, like at all (obviously not the best). Not enough to really complain.

After doing that it a crackling noise started to come from the back of the TV. To me I associate the sound it was making with something that is about to catch fire electronically. So I quickly unplugged it, cleared everything away and got a fire extinguisher. Gave it some time, turned it back on and it made the noise again, figured I'd unplug and leave it off for a while. I'm not comfortable using it or leaving it plugged in when not in the house,the few times I have used it, the noise did not return but I don't want to take the risk.  I had posted a question asking if anyone else had had this issue but no one else has. TCL's customer service did respond to me and advised me to send an email referencing the question etc,  I did send an email as soon as I had all the information I thought they would want and included the amazon order. I have not heard back from them so since my time is running out (30 day return policy) I am probably going to return it to be on the safe side and get something a little more expensive but hopefully without this possible danger.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": "\n      Size: 55 inches"}},

That turned out to be a couple of sheets of diagrams that were drawn by a crazed engineer, so were discarded. I did manage to screw on the feet, locate the HDMI ports and \"audio out\" port so that I could hook up my cable Tivo box, Apple TV box, Amazon Fire TV box, Blu-ray DVD player, and my external speakers. Turned the TV on and all I got was a message that said \"checking for updates\" and a spinning circle. After 45 minutes I turned the TV off and back on and then it let me set up the TV. Wanted to make some settings changes to the TV and it took FOREVER to locate the \"Settings' menu, which was cleverly located in a very inconspicuous place. Had to enter passwords for Netflix and Amazon Prime. Tried to get cable Tivo controller to control TV functions, but had to give up and get our local cable tech to do it. He did it in about 30 seconds. The Mariners game on Wednesday was going to be broadcast only on Facebook, so I had to download the Facebook app. Once I downloaded it, it took me forever to locate it on my Amazon Fire TV  Home screen.

Watching golf, a guy on the green putting from some distance away appears distorted - face is smeared out.  A minute later, on a close up, the face is clear as can be.  I don't think it's the camera man. I've tried running hdmi straight from my xfinity x1 box to IN-2 and IN-3 to eliminate my AVR.  I tried eliminating xfinity as well by going to Prime and watching Star Trek Beyond allegedly in 4K.  (In these apps, the Display doesn't show what resolution you are getting).  I watched simultaneously with my 8 year old Panasonic 3d tv and x900f was only slightly better.  I have tweaked all the settings using rtings recommendations.  These settings produce an overblown vivid color rendition that is unacceptable.  As to other questions:  Does x900f upscale to 4K automatically?  If so, Display only shows a resolution of 1080.  Is that correct?  When I go to the Action Menu and to Picture settings, there is a pause of 5 to 10 seconds before the sub menu appears on the right side of the screen.  Took me awhile to wait it out.  Either I have a bad tv or ...?  Unless I can get it improved, I am going to have to return it.

Now I also purchased a new 2017 Samsung tv...for the comparison, I believe the Samsung has a bit of an edge on a better picture, but the TCL blows it away for ability to constant stream without buffering, (though situated further from the router), its ability to download any app (Samsung cannot) and it is simply super easy to use. Doing it again, I would not have purchased the Samsung. The TCL price is amazing for a really great tv. I have learned that any issues are the apps creation. Such as DirectTv was constantly buffering with a lousy video.  Not a problem with Sling or Hulu. So a tiny learning curve with a pleasing outcome.

I have had it for a few months now and I am really thrilled with it.  The picture quality is amazing.  A few things about it to warn, the base is pretty wide, but there's no bottom of it so it's tough to put it on anything other than a flat surface like a table.  I was hoping to rest it on my receiver (it's in a secondary bedroom and it's an old receiver I'm not too concerned if it breaks) but it was just a tad too unstable so I couldn't.  Also the remote is horrible...there's really no other way to say it.  It's cheap and I'd recommend using another remote.  Really any other remote.  But for the basics it does work, I can't really complain except I use Harmony remotes so I'm sort of a snob.  The refresh is great I don't see any artifacts or anything, there is not much heat given off either.  Admittedly I have not tried any of the fine tuning of the picture (if it even offers that) I got this for the bedroom where I watch the occasional movie or game.

The TV remote range is garbage, pitiful. I have to sit forward a hold my arm as high as I can. I am also super cheap so I have my TV sitting on a chair so the wood on the chair might be partially blocking the signal, if properly mounted it could improve that. So, if you're going to be cheap and put this on the floor or on another piece of furniture instead of wall mounting this, and since you're looking at this TV it is fair to assume you may be a cheap guy like me, you might have to get super close with the remote.

So far so good.  Replaced a brand new tv from Best Buy that was fine until I turned the sound as high as it would go and it came out tinny.  Which the salesperson said was because I didn't pair it with a sound bar.  I disagreed. I think it's a pretty simple principle that if your tv volume goes up to 100 it should work well up to 100.  Sound bars simply amplify existing quality.  I digress.  Enter the TCL 40in Smart tv.  At it's highest it has excellent sound quality, clear sharp picture image and user friendly settings.  Assembly and connection took less than 30 minutes for both, without help from my honey.  My only issue and it's a big one for me, is that the hdmi ports are placed vertically near the bottom of the unit.  What's wrong with that?  I'm glad you asked.  Take a look at the picture accompanying this review.  See that rectangular depression on the lower right?  That's your hdmi port.  They must not have any common sense courses at MIT because why in the hell would you design a space that was specifically included for attaching media hardware without making accommodations for the size of hardware it's meant to house?  In anticipation of this purchase, I had 2 alexa 2nd generation firesticks waiting for new homes.  Guess what?  Can't use em.  \"Alexa, find me an electronics Engineer who can do basic 3rd grade math\" returns no results.  Nothing was wrong with my 20 year old fatbacks.  The only reason I bought smart tvs was to replace the cable mafia with firesticks.  You will be able to install a 1st gen (original model) firestick on this tv.

The 2018 Q7 has the WIDEST color Gamut and Color Volume on the market wider then everything including the q9,sony/lg Oleds...  It is also the brightest sustained set on the market at 800 cd/m2 sustained.. Oleds are only about 150 cd/m2.  That brightness translates into shockingly bright brilliant colors and whites. However, even though edge lit.. the ability to produce inky blacks even at full backlight  is amazing. In normal lighting Blacks will look Coal Black, indistinguishable from the TV being off... at night in a dark room the Blacks are not True black like a FALD or Oled, but still - the best ever for an edge lit.. and no clouding or light leakage.. The picture is VERY uniform in both light and dark colors..  The OS is fantastic and fast. Using built in Netflix and youtube is very snapy..", "verification": null, "product_type": null}},

The idea behind having just one cord coming down from the TV is great and makes it very visually appealing especially if you will use ambient mode. Ambient mode is a way for the TV to mimic the colors and decor of your walls so that it can blend it like a picture frame. It is really cool to see but don\u2019t know how often I would really use it. The Tv has worked flawlessly with the built in apps and browser I was able to use all of my normal subscriptions right away and the picture, sound and color is amazing! My only issue has been with the one connect box, the unit I have gotten seems to be defective because it is not recognizing any of the devices that I have connected by hdmi. I even tried doing a factory restore and starting the TV from the beginning but it still did not work. In the end Samsung customer service has said they would send me a new one connect box to replace my defective one. Hopefully that one will actually work.

Being able to see set and costume imperfections almost detracts from shows that previously looked great.  After getting used to this picture, everything else will look blurry.  Set-up was fast and easy.  We also connected a Sony sound bar/subwoofer, a PlayStation 4, and a Comcast/Charter DVR cable box.  The IR blaster option is a GREAT way to work around remote compatibility issues.  We have tried to have a 1 remote solution for years and have never gotten it quite right.  Now, for the first time, we have a single remote that controls everything.  It is wonderful.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this TV.  We have not been able to get our Alexa to do anything useful other than turn it on and off.  Lesson learned: we went through the set-up process, before connecting the sound-bar.  Once we connected the sound bar, we could not get it to work with menu options.  We had to reset the factory defaults, and then go through the entire set-up process again for the sound-bar to work.  Same thing happened when we then connected to Alexa.  I recommend connecting everything before you start for the first time.  Alexa has been mostly useless, but not sure if that is an Alexa or TV problem.  Menus and not incredibly intuitive or easy to navigate, and many major apps don't support 4K Google TV yet (like VEVO or Amazon Music) - but eventually they will get there.  Even with those shortfalls this is an amazing TV.  Picture and sound quality is the best I have ever had.  Very thin and very attractive.  Bright vibrant colors are sharp and crystal clear.

It took an hour or so to set it up solo and get on it the stand without overstressing the unit. In the end it worked out.

Heavier than I expected but it IS a 55\". Great picture quality and great features. The only gripe I have, which others may have mentioned is the power cord. Samsung what are you doing? The power cord is shorter then most cords AND with their wire management system it's impossible to use if you don't have an outlet directly behind the TV. Great for wall-mounting but most TVs sit on a stand. We had to opt not to use their wire management built in. Our TV is going on a swivel stand but even still, the cord is going to be shorter then it needs to be. Big downfall there on Samsungs part with the short cord. I'm not taking a star off for that but heads up folks. Still an awesome TV and i'd buy it again. The remote is interesting. I have the best/smartest Harmony remote already but am simplifying things and planning to just use their One Remote. I wish they added a few more buttons on the remote for cable boxes (GUIDE BUTTON!) but it's sleek/small and does the job.

This happened while I was playing a recorded program from my HDD player. I stopped the playback and then restarted it and the sound was all right again. This has happened a number of times since then. Earlier today I was watching an over the air broadcast and for the first time, the OTA sound started the studdering and in order to get it to stop, I had to turn off the channel and then go back to it. I am old and I wear hearing aids in both ears so what I hear may not sound too me like it would to someone else.

One of the few things I've been slightly bothered is the sound quality. I'm going to have to buy a sound bar or some other kind of speaker set because the TV speakers aren't great and I've had to have it turned nearly all the way up with majority of the things I watch. Otherwise it's been pretty awesome. The only reason I'm not giving picture quality 5-stars is because it's been glitching a bit; it could be due to Comcast, but it's still 50/50...I'll update later if that changes. It's definitely a light weight TV, however once you've placed it on whatever surface you're using it's kind of difficult to maneuver it around. It can be a bit wobbly, just trying to pick it up to adjust it the base can feel a little unstable and make the TV feel slightly top heavy.

This set is almost the same physical size as the old one with a thinner bezel and therefore slightly larger screen. This new set looked perfectly fine when we first began using it, but increasingly it seemed pale on some scenes and washed out. I finally figured out what was happening. I was walking across the room while watching the TV and I noticed a color shift as I moved to the side. I'm not talking about an extreme viewing angle here. I mean just a few feet off center and the picture quality changes. Our set is positioned in the corner of the room and my wife sits directly in front of it about 12 feet away. My chair is exactly 4 feet to the left of hers and just slightly closer. There is a big difference in the picture quality from her chair to mine. I have included photos to illustrate my point. They were shot with a high quality camera with the settings locked so the exposure couldn't change from one comparison photo to the next. One can plainly see in the photos, as well as the naked eye, that the picture quality degrades considerably.

They did not work so I attempted to call Samsung back. I kept getting an automated message stating \u201cyour call can not be completed as dialed\u201d so I went on live chat and they gave me a different number. The woman who answered put me on hold three different times, which was fine, but then at the end told me I needed to drive the TV to a repair shop, 50 minutes away mind you, and have them look at it. I told her this was unacceptable as I don\u2019t have access to a car daily and I work 12 hour shifts Monday to Friday. She then told me a technician could come out, at some time to look at the tv. When I told her I would not be able to accomadate this as I don\u2019t have many days off and I can\u2019t wait for a technician to look at a 200$ tv, she said, that\u2019s all we can offer, a technician will be out, then hung up on me. I attempted to call back the same number and again received the automated message that my call was not completed as dialed even though I had just used it. I have never had such terrible customer service and we buy many televisions and electronic devices. All I want is to return the device and get a new one sent or get a refund as this tv is not even 3 months old.

My chair is exactly 4 feet to the left of hers and just slightly closer. There is a big difference in the picture quality from her chair to mine. I have included photos to illustrate my point.

Heavier than I expected but it IS a 55\". Great picture quality and great features. The only gripe I have, which others may have mentioned is the power cord. Samsung what are you doing? The power cord is shorter then most cords AND with their wire management system it's impossible to use if you don't have an outlet directly behind the TV. Great for wall-mounting but most TVs sit on a stand. We had to opt not to use their wire management built in. Our TV is going on a swivel stand but even still, the cord is going to be shorter then it needs to be. Big downfall there on Samsungs part with the short cord. I'm not taking a star off for that but heads up folks. Still an awesome TV and i'd buy it again. The remote is interesting. I have the best/smartest Harmony remote already but am simplifying things and planning to just use their One Remote. I wish they added a few more buttons on the remote for cable boxes (GUIDE BUTTON!) but it's sleek/small and does the job.

I am old and I wear hearing aids in both ears so what I hear may not sound too me like it would to someone else.

There is a button that says agree to all. Just highlight the terms you agree to and press continue.all the apps are great quick processing between apps. One feature I was not aware of was the Bluetooth pairing right to my sound bar! Or Bluetooth headphone whatever works for you. This is a huge upgrade from my last hd tv.

This isn't possible with the Sony model I have, whereas the Samsung seamlessly connects to most of the headphones I own. The picture is magnificent, and the interface is easy to operate. There are 4 different picture settings, and it's important to adjust them based on what you are watching. Sports and movies look quite different in each of the modes. The remote is very basic and straightforward, and is the opposite of the Sony remote. It was easy to pair this TV with my DirecTV remote, so I have more flexibility in controlling the TV that way.

It arrived in a well-designed, protective box that was easy to maneuver. I removed the TV from the box without a hitch and began to get it operational.  It went flawlessly.  Straight-forward instructions (e-owners manual online and other onscreen insturctions) allowed for an easy flow from the box to watching our first program. It took 3 days for me to get it fully operational but one could do it faster.  I just decided on the steps I wanted to follow and all went well.  We were watching cable tv the first day, the APPS came the second day and full connections to accessories (sound bar, Amazon Fire-Stick, and DVD player) the third day.  The picture took a bit of tweaking and is really a matter of personal preference. I simply followed onscreen instructions until we found the adjustments we liked.  I believe we now have the best picture on a TV we've ever had. It seems to be a great product.

I have not gamed on it. Picture is pretty good just dont expect really inky blacks because its an LED not an OLED. There are a lot of picture adjustment options but its decent right out of the box. Speakers are fine and it was easy to mount. So my only grip with this TV is how long it takes to pick up a WiFi signal when you turn it on. When you turn it off, it goes into a sleep mode of sorts so that you can choose to have it power on with your last used app up and ready to go. Problem is, sometimes when you turn it and and try to start playing internet content right away, it will say you have no internet connection. Reason being sometimes it just takes a while to re-connect to your WiFi after being turned off. So the only remedy to this is to just wait until it picks up the signal. My ritual at night is I turn it on, then I brush my teeth so when I come back I know it will be connected and ready to go. I used to try to just turn it on and go right into watching netflix but then it would say \"no internet connection\" and ask me if I wanted to troubleshoot. I am on the latest firmware update also.

Agreeing to it means the TV can record, store, and send to Samsung a lot of what you do and say in your house...  That is just wrong.... companies today are very over reaching with what they are doing... another thing I found out when I started the YouTube app... it gave me a code which I needed to enter in a webpage with  my computer.. after several times trying, it would not activate YouTube... I was using Internet Explorer and finally decided to use Chrome and it activated right away...

I also have a 65 inch Sony Bravia, and I prefer the Samsung for a number of reasons. First and foremost, using bluetooth to listen to the TV through wireless headphones is a priority for me. This isn't possible with the Sony model I have, whereas the Samsung seamlessly connects to most of the headphones I own. The picture is magnificent, and the interface is easy to operate. There are 4 different picture settings, and it's important to adjust them based on what you are watching. Sports and movies look quite different in each of the modes. The remote is very basic and straightforward, and is the opposite of the Sony remote. It was easy to pair this TV with my DirecTV remote, so I have more flexibility in controlling the TV that way. The TV was also easy to unpack and mount. Overall, I don't have any complaints with this TV. At the price I paid for it, it's a bargain.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

After reading many reviews of 2016/2017 40-44 inch models, we decided on Samsung once again (we've had about 3 months).  So far so good. It arrived in a well-designed, protective box that was easy to maneuver. I removed the TV from the box without a hitch and began to get it operational.  It went flawlessly.  Straight-forward instructions (e-owners manual online and other onscreen insturctions) allowed for an easy flow from the box to watching our first program. It took 3 days for me to get it fully operational but one could do it faster.  I just decided on the steps I wanted to follow and all went well.  We were watching cable tv the first day, the APPS came the second day and full connections to accessories (sound bar, Amazon Fire-Stick, and DVD player) the third day.  The picture took a bit of tweaking and is really a matter of personal preference. I simply followed onscreen instructions until we found the adjustments we liked.  I believe we now have the best picture on a TV we've ever had. It seems to be a great product.  Time will tell of course.  4 stars only because it is too new for 5.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

If you change your HDMI input configuration you can run the setup program again to have the unit rescan and identify the inputs. Supposedly this set is HDR10 compliant, but I noticed when setting my Sony X800 4K player HDMI 1 output to HDR nothing is displayed at the TV. (may need to check HDMI cable version or maybe Sony doesn't play well with Samsung). Overall picture is very good with limited motion blur. Sound is good also.

However, this TV started to loose it's charm within a year. It has some blur issue in case of to much movement for few videos. And, now & then this Tv frequently get hang & need to force restart. Also, the number of apps are extremely limited as you don't have google play in it. Recently, they have added google play movie only. Hence, you cannot add popular app like Sling, which you have to do via chrome cast. Though 4K videos are really impressive & I tested that in Netflix. Sound are ok as I use external speaker for that. So, for me sound is not a big issue. And, this model doesn't have any blue tooth feature. So, you cannot add any device, which has blue tooth. Considering these limitations - I would stick to 3.

Heavier than I expected but it IS a 55\". Great picture quality and great features. The only gripe I have, which others may have mentioned is the power cord. Samsung what are you doing? The power cord is shorter then most cords AND with their wire management system it's impossible to use if you don't have an outlet directly behind the TV. Great for wall-mounting but most TVs sit on a stand. We had to opt not to use their wire management built in. Our TV is going on a swivel stand but even still, the cord is going to be shorter then it needs to be. Big downfall there on Samsungs part with the short cord. I'm not taking a star off for that but heads up folks. Still an awesome TV and i'd buy it again. The remote is interesting. I have the best/smartest Harmony remote already but am simplifying things and planning to just use their One Remote. I wish they added a few more buttons on the remote for cable boxes (GUIDE BUTTON!) but it's sleek/small and does the job.

Otherwise it's been pretty awesome. The only reason I'm not giving picture quality 5-stars is because it's been glitching a bit; it could be due to Comcast, but it's still 50/50...I'll update later if that changes. It's definitely a light weight TV, however once you've placed it on whatever surface you're using it's kind of difficult to maneuver it around. It can be a bit wobbly, just trying to pick it up to adjust it the base can feel a little unstable and make the TV feel slightly top heavy.

I've had a Roku device for a long time, so I was right at home.  I also like the small Roku remote, which I prefer to the \"spaceship\" remotes of other brands.  Set up was simple.  I honestly believe is Apple made a TV, it would be like this TCL.  Simple, intuitive, and everything you need and nothing you don't.  My only beef is that there are only three HDMI inputs, but I knew that going in.  That said, the built-in Roku means I don't have to use an HDMI to hook up a Roku box, so that sort of makes up for it.  Maybe TCL has improved their quality control, but so far I am satisfied.  Beware that if you buy this TV at Best Buy, you get an inferior remote that does not work with voice commands.  The version of the TV sold by Amazon comes with the superior remote.

So, when the bedroom TV gave up the ghost, we thought this was a natural choice.  It was a little pricey, but has the 4K HDR, and we already new we would appreciate that, having a Vizio in the living room with the same features.  The Vizio gives us problems showing the HDR from the Roku, but having Roku integrated into this TCL means there are no problems at all.  Much prefer it to the Smartcast feature in the Vizio.  One little thing bugs me about this TV.  Plugging anything into the headphone jack mutes the sound, even if there is no headphone attached.  Other TVs only mute if there is a headphone to complete the circuit.  This means I can't use my wireless headphones, because when the base station is plugged in, the TV mutes itself.  Most other TVs you can leave the base station plugged in, and the TV only mutes when the headphones are in use.  Yes, I can use headphones plugged into the remote or into my smart phone with the app, but the sound quality is terrible compared to the sound I get with the Sennheiser wireless headphones.  I should also mention that the carton the TV came in was in rough shape, as others have mentioned, but luckily the TV itself is fine, having survived the trip with nary a scratch.  Overall, this TV is an excellent value at this price, and it is hard to imagine anyone being unhappy with it as long as it is working and is reliable long-term.

The amount of features TCL packed into this TV for the price is nothing short of impressive. I've not noticed any defects or quality control issues on my set, but other reviewers have, so I recommend paying very close attention the first few days to check for any manufacturers' defects. There were no dead pixels or banding issues on my screen. The only negative aspect of the TV which I noticed is the screen uniformity. When you display a solid color image you notice that the corners are slightly dimmer than the center of the screen. This is not noticeable under normal viewing conditions but it is noticeable if you run a screen test that displays solid colors, which I recommend everyone does. The good things about this TV far outweigh the bad, and you can't expect perfection at this price range.

I had a 15 year old Samsung DLP, but not just a DLP, it was the best DLP ever made. No light bulbs, no spinning mirrors, no moving parts. After 12 or 13 years, it started getting white spots, so I  replaced the DLP chip myself and it was great again until the remote, and switches would not respond, So in comes the 65\" LG, this is the biggest I've bought so far, the others were 62\", and a little smaller. This one is big in the bedroom, it's like being at a drive-in. The color is good, nothing blares out to me in the picture that I could complain about. I should tell you that I know  what a good picture should look like, and there are a lot of bad TV out there. The LG has a setup that it takes you through to set it up, that was OK.  I got rid of DirecTV, and use DirecTVNow through a 4k FireTV box, and it works really well, and cut my TV bill by 75% . You do have to have Internet to get DirecTVNow, it is a streaming service, but it works really well for me. They gave me 125 channels, and HBO for $55 a month, plus I can record.  It's all new, and so far, so good. The LG looked really good on my FireTV, and  DirecTVNow, which is an app on the FireTV.  I did buy a sound bar with a floor standing woofer, but to be honest, the LG was the first really flat Tv to have decent sound. The sound bar and woofer were a bit better, but not so much that I would cry if I didn't have it. It was a Vizio soundbar I bought in a local club store. The TV box came double boxed by Fedex, and the Fedex guy brought it inside, but wanted to leave it outside and make me bring it in. The TV is light, and you have to put legs on it. each leg takes three screws, and they are labeled A and B, so pay attention, or the Tv might be tipsy on you if you put them on backwards.  This TV was bought with a 4 year warranty, yes, it cost a little more, but read the details,  they fix it in your home, and if they can't fix it they refund your money, how can you beat that. I keep all my electronics on a UPS  battery backup. I live in the lightning belt, and lightening will kill a TV, and many other electronics things very easily. Worse than that, it can cause a hard to find problem, one that many TV repair shops might have trouble fixing. It can even cause multiple problems, making it even harder to fix. I have been on UPS battery backup for 20 years, and yes , I have to replace batteries, and and in some cases I had to replace the UPS, that is way better than having all sorts of problems with my TV's, and other electronics stuff. This LG Tv is a bargain, it is a 2018 model, and supports Google Home, and Amazon Alesis . It has bluetooth to connect to a  bluetooth sound bar.. So let me share my experience in the local club store when I bought the sound bar.  I asked if any of them come with wire connections to the TV , as well as Bluetooth.  I worked in electronics my whole life, and I would rather use wire. In any case, he said no, they all use bluetooth, no wire. So I get it home and open the box and there is an optical cable, a 3,5mm cable, and one other cable, so there was 4 ways to connect that sound bar to my TV, not just Bluetooth. So  I used the Toslink optical cable to connect the sound bar, but now, about the TV and the sound bar. I had the center channel working on the optical cable, and before that I had it on the 3.5mm wire to my cell phone to hear what it sounded like. When the TV came on it dropped the woofer, which does connect with Bluetooth to the sound bar.  So I turned the TV off, and back on, and that was all it needed,  all the sound came on as it should. No hassle, it just did its thing and worked. Their are a lot of apps in this TV, so if you are not fortunate enough to have FireTv with a Prime account, which is awesome, and I highly recommend it, the Tv has a lot of other streaming services built into it.  One of them is Amazon, but that way of getting Amazon content, in no way compares to FireTV, but there are many other apps also.. You can also plus a USB thumb drive , or maybe even a usb hard drive into the back of the TV and watch video, pictures and music from it, It works really well. Then there are plenty of HDMI connectors, although I only needed one.  The remote does leave a little room to complain, the buttons could have been bigger, especially the ones you would use in the dark. Ok, I can replace the remote with a programmable touch screen, but why should i need to do that? Are you reading this LG, get with it , make a great remote for this great TV.  You should be able to get 12 to 14, or more feet from a screen this big,  Some people get lemons, some people don't know what a good picture is, and some people just like to complain, try to know the difference when you read reviews.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

I was a little concerned about setting it up with the TV provider when have, but that was NOT a problem. This is the first smart TV I've owned, and now I know why they're called 'smart'. It practically sets itself up! The default setting has a VERY annoying female voice that guides you through all the set-up. It wouldn't be so bad other than for the fact that she talks so fast you can barely understand her. It's easy to disable that in settings. I like every feature of this TV and highly recommend it if you're in the market for a smart TV. The price is hard to believe for what you get.

They were only a delivery service, an 82\u201d TV was sent out with no setup. You can\u2019t unbox something this size, you cut the box away. It took an hour or so to set it up solo and get on it the stand without overstressing the unit. In the end it worked out.

Heavier than I expected but it IS a 55\". Great picture quality and great features. The only gripe I have, which others may have mentioned is the power cord. Samsung what are you doing? The power cord is shorter then most cords AND with their wire management system it's impossible to use if you don't have an outlet directly behind the TV. Great for wall-mounting but most TVs sit on a stand. We had to opt not to use their wire management built in. Our TV is going on a swivel stand but even still, the cord is going to be shorter then it needs to be. Big downfall there on Samsungs part with the short cord. I'm not taking a star off for that but heads up folks. Still an awesome TV and i'd buy it again. The remote is interesting. I have the best/smartest Harmony remote already but am simplifying things and planning to just use their One Remote. I wish they added a few more buttons on the remote for cable boxes (GUIDE BUTTON!) but it's sleek/small and does the job.

I spent a lot of time with the different video settings but, really, the default ones suit me fine. When I first turned this unit on the Smoothing effect was on high. I've since turned it off because even on low setting videos look like a soap opera. In my neck of the woods I don't get many over-the-air (OTA) channels and have to settle for just a handful of \"old people\" stations. The internet connection in my building is relatively weak; however, when it does work well, I can stream movies from VUDU in high definition without much interruptions. I plan to keep this piece of electronica around for a few years. I'd originally bought the 49\" inch version but, because my vision is not the greatest in the world, returned it for this 55 incher.

Amazon delivery sent 2 movers who delivered it, unpacked it, attached the stand, plugged it up to make sure it worked and removed all the packaging.

The TV stand has the feet on the ends of the TV and just enough height, so it allowed me to place my JBL 3.1 soundbar directly underneath the TV for a clean finished look, while still having amazing sound. The remote is improved in its design and function. Amazon sells the premium version with the RF remote so you can point it anywhere and the TV will pick up the signal, unlike the BB version which comes with an IR remote and has to be pointed directly at the sensor on the TV or it won't work. The TCL remote is also slightly flatter and wider then previous TCL TV remotes and it fits in your hand better. They also made the play/pause button larger and with a slight indentation so you can work it in complete darkness simply by feel, which is great! Set up of the TV was a breeze with the ROKU operating system and basic picture adjustments are simple and straightforward using the TCL remote.

I've had a Roku device for a long time, so I was right at home.  I also like the small Roku remote, which I prefer to the \"spaceship\" remotes of other brands.  Set up was simple.  I honestly believe is Apple made a TV, it would be like this TCL.  Simple, intuitive, and everything you need and nothing you don't.  My only beef is that there are only three HDMI inputs, but I knew that going in.  That said, the built-in Roku means I don't have to use an HDMI to hook up a Roku box, so that sort of makes up for it.  Maybe TCL has improved their quality control, but so far I am satisfied.  Beware that if you buy this TV at Best Buy, you get an inferior remote that does not work with voice commands.  The version of the TV sold by Amazon comes with the superior remote.

So, when the bedroom TV gave up the ghost, we thought this was a natural choice.  It was a little pricey, but has the 4K HDR, and we already new we would appreciate that, having a Vizio in the living room with the same features.  The Vizio gives us problems showing the HDR from the Roku, but having Roku integrated into this TCL means there are no problems at all.  Much prefer it to the Smartcast feature in the Vizio.  One little thing bugs me about this TV.  Plugging anything into the headphone jack mutes the sound, even if there is no headphone attached.  Other TVs only mute if there is a headphone to complete the circuit.  This means I can't use my wireless headphones, because when the base station is plugged in, the TV mutes itself.  Most other TVs you can leave the base station plugged in, and the TV only mutes when the headphones are in use.  Yes, I can use headphones plugged into the remote or into my smart phone with the app, but the sound quality is terrible compared to the sound I get with the Sennheiser wireless headphones.  I should also mention that the carton the TV came in was in rough shape, as others have mentioned, but luckily the TV itself is fine, having survived the trip with nary a scratch.  Overall, this TV is an excellent value at this price, and it is hard to imagine anyone being unhappy with it as long as it is working and is reliable long-term.

The amount of features TCL packed into this TV for the price is nothing short of impressive. I've not noticed any defects or quality control issues on my set, but other reviewers have, so I recommend paying very close attention the first few days to check for any manufacturers' defects. There were no dead pixels or banding issues on my screen. The only negative aspect of the TV which I noticed is the screen uniformity. When you display a solid color image you notice that the corners are slightly dimmer than the center of the screen. This is not noticeable under normal viewing conditions but it is noticeable if you run a screen test that displays solid colors, which I recommend everyone does. The good things about this TV far outweigh the bad, and you can't expect perfection at this price range.

I had a 15 year old Samsung DLP, but not just a DLP, it was the best DLP ever made. No light bulbs, no spinning mirrors, no moving parts. After 12 or 13 years, it started getting white spots, so I  replaced the DLP chip myself and it was great again until the remote, and switches would not respond, So in comes the 65\" LG, this is the biggest I've bought so far, the others were 62\", and a little smaller. This one is big in the bedroom, it's like being at a drive-in. The color is good, nothing blares out to me in the picture that I could complain about. I should tell you that I know  what a good picture should look like, and there are a lot of bad TV out there. The LG has a setup that it takes you through to set it up, that was OK.  I got rid of DirecTV, and use DirecTVNow through a 4k FireTV box, and it works really well, and cut my TV bill by 75% . You do have to have Internet to get DirecTVNow, it is a streaming service, but it works really well for me. They gave me 125 channels, and HBO for $55 a month, plus I can record.  It's all new, and so far, so good. The LG looked really good on my FireTV, and  DirecTVNow, which is an app on the FireTV.  I did buy a sound bar with a floor standing woofer, but to be honest, the LG was the first really flat Tv to have decent sound. The sound bar and woofer were a bit better, but not so much that I would cry if I didn't have it. It was a Vizio soundbar I bought in a local club store. The TV box came double boxed by Fedex, and the Fedex guy brought it inside, but wanted to leave it outside and make me bring it in. The TV is light, and you have to put legs on it. each leg takes three screws, and they are labeled A and B, so pay attention, or the Tv might be tipsy on you if you put them on backwards.  This TV was bought with a 4 year warranty, yes, it cost a little more, but read the details,  they fix it in your home, and if they can't fix it they refund your money, how can you beat that. I keep all my electronics on a UPS  battery backup. I live in the lightning belt, and lightening will kill a TV, and many other electronics things very easily. Worse than that, it can cause a hard to find problem, one that many TV repair shops might have trouble fixing. It can even cause multiple problems, making it even harder to fix. I have been on UPS battery backup for 20 years, and yes , I have to replace batteries, and and in some cases I had to replace the UPS, that is way better than having all sorts of problems with my TV's, and other electronics stuff. This LG Tv is a bargain, it is a 2018 model, and supports Google Home, and Amazon Alesis . It has bluetooth to connect to a  bluetooth sound bar.. So let me share my experience in the local club store when I bought the sound bar.  I asked if any of them come with wire connections to the TV , as well as Bluetooth.  I worked in electronics my whole life, and I would rather use wire. In any case, he said no, they all use bluetooth, no wire. So I get it home and open the box and there is an optical cable, a 3,5mm cable, and one other cable, so there was 4 ways to connect that sound bar to my TV, not just Bluetooth. So  I used the Toslink optical cable to connect the sound bar, but now, about the TV and the sound bar. I had the center channel working on the optical cable, and before that I had it on the 3.5mm wire to my cell phone to hear what it sounded like. When the TV came on it dropped the woofer, which does connect with Bluetooth to the sound bar.  So I turned the TV off, and back on, and that was all it needed,  all the sound came on as it should. No hassle, it just did its thing and worked. Their are a lot of apps in this TV, so if you are not fortunate enough to have FireTv with a Prime account, which is awesome, and I highly recommend it, the Tv has a lot of other streaming services built into it.  One of them is Amazon, but that way of getting Amazon content, in no way compares to FireTV, but there are many other apps also.. You can also plus a USB thumb drive , or maybe even a usb hard drive into the back of the TV and watch video, pictures and music from it, It works really well. Then there are plenty of HDMI connectors, although I only needed one.  The remote does leave a little room to complain, the buttons could have been bigger, especially the ones you would use in the dark. Ok, I can replace the remote with a programmable touch screen, but why should i need to do that? Are you reading this LG, get with it , make a great remote for this great TV.  You should be able to get 12 to 14, or more feet from a screen this big,  Some people get lemons, some people don't know what a good picture is, and some people just like to complain, try to know the difference when you read reviews.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

I was pleasantly surprised with the integration of the TV antenna and HDMI inputs, very smooth and I like the instant preview of the tuner in the interface without having to truly switch to it.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": "\n      Size: 43 inches"}},

The first one that came had a cracked screen and Amazon replaced it immediately! (thanks!). This TV (55\") is really huge and the picture quality in my honest opinion is very clear. Please note if you use cable, I noticed yesterday when trying the cable channels, almost all the channels are HD 1080. So you may not see any difference in the picture quality (except that the screen might be much larger) in the cable channels (e.g., CNNHD). But, there are many movies and also Youtube clips that are in 4K and you can really enjoy them. What I noticed is that even 1080 provides a good quality for my eyes. I could hardly notice if a picture is 1080 or 4K, but I can tell you the 4K quality seemed just to be very real. Given the largeness of the screen, you could think you were there in person (something you can't possibly feel with 1080). The Ruko environment is wonderfully easy (I already had a Roku account from the past). For its price, I think this TV is a bargain. Overall, my previous TV (LG 42\" 3D HD) was already really good so I was in doubt whether paying an extra $400+ (price and tax) would justify, but now I can see it was worth. It's like having a small-scale movie theatre in your home. Lastly, I read among the reviews (before buying the TV) that some people had complained about the TV's speaker (so I had thought I needed also to buy a separate speaker!). Honestly, I find the speakers really awesome! I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about. I agree it is not the best speaker you may see, but I find the sound quality and volume to be really good (note: I am only an ordinary use, not a tech savvy who can distinguish microscopic differences).

People are so caught up on 4K.. HDR (High Dynamic Range) make a better difference to the eye than 4K (Google it). Now there are two types of HDR, some have both but this one has HDR10 which is the endustry standard (Dolby Vision HDR is better but not as popular and barely can tell a difference). Let me say I was so worried that this TV would ship and I would be upset. This was not the case... the TV comes with Roku (a value in itself) and a very user friendly remote. Some people complain about the viewing angles and sound but to be honest - I really don't think it's bad, like at all (obviously not the best). Not enough to really complain.

After doing that it a crackling noise started to come from the back of the TV. To me I associate the sound it was making with something that is about to catch fire electronically. So I quickly unplugged it, cleared everything away and got a fire extinguisher. Gave it some time, turned it back on and it made the noise again, figured I'd unplug and leave it off for a while. I'm not comfortable using it or leaving it plugged in when not in the house,the few times I have used it, the noise did not return but I don't want to take the risk.  I had posted a question asking if anyone else had had this issue but no one else has. TCL's customer service did respond to me and advised me to send an email referencing the question etc,  I did send an email as soon as I had all the information I thought they would want and included the amazon order. I have not heard back from them so since my time is running out (30 day return policy) I am probably going to return it to be on the safe side and get something a little more expensive but hopefully without this possible danger.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

Amazon stated that I could only return the TV.  Best Buy stated that they would replace it, but I had to go through Amazon, and Amazon refused to replace it.  I went to Best Buy locally, and they stated that they could not override Amazon's return policy for Prime Day electronics.  I contacted Toshiba to attempt to utilize the warranty, but they stated that since it was new they would not replace it and that I needed to return it to Amazon.  So I had to take it apart (no biggie) and place it back inside of the box.  Luckily I had the box and styrofoam inserts still.  Then I had to lug it to a UPS store to send it back to Amazon for a refund.  I will never buy electronics on Prime Day again.

My first HDTV was a Vizio 42 inch 1080p that i bought almost 5 years ago after high school. It looked great. I Paid $420 for it. I thought i got a pretty good deal on it. Fast forward to 2018 and 4k is still settling in and technology is moving forward. I was at work during Prime week and the website was terribly slow but i still wanted to see what they had in stock. I stumbled across this TV as i was going to be in the market for one during the holiday season 2018. When i found this TV, I was shocked at how much it was! $280! For a 50 inch 4k Fire TV with Alex built in, That's almost half the cost of my old vizio. I thought it was too good to be true. Reviews were mixed but i wanted to take a stab at it anyways. I ordered it and it was here 3 days later. My initial impressions were \"eh\". Setup was a breeze but there was more than that i had noticed. I decided on comparing it with my vizio with some Good Mythical Morning on YouTube. I Know it's compressed video but it was the best i had to work with at first. I watched one episode and I was kind of Disappointed. The Brightness was good but the color was kind of dull overall and over saturated on some parts of the image like a person's face, but i wasn't giving up there. Setting the TV's Picture color setting from default to natural completely changed the game. The Color was great! Everything seemed correct with pulling up a color correction test on YouTube and it looked great! The Speakers were OK but that doesn't bother me because i have a dedicated 5.1 Surround System that blows the socks on the TV speakers. I really wanted a bigger size TV overall since the 42 inch wasn't quite the size I wanted. The 50 Inch was the perfect size for my TV stand and it matched the room which is a pretty small living room but it worked just fine. Now it's $400 and i still think it's a good deal considering my 42 inch was $20 more. I run the TV 1080p still because my laptop does not output 4k but It still looks great. The Fire TV portion is good for what it offers. More Ad's than I liked but for the value, No big deal. The 4k Netflix Shows look great. HDR Looks really good. The only downside to this TV for me is when i'm playing Dolby Digital through any apps on the smart portion of the TV, the volume seems to fluctuate. I'm sure this can be fixed with a software update but It's what i experienced. I would give it a go if you're interested in getting a good TV for the Money and hey if It doesn't work out, 30 Day Return!", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

I wouldn\u2019t accept that answer so she had me send some pictures and they would email me back.  I was shocked at the response (see email pic)!  The fact that their service department doesn\u2019t see any defect is insulting to me.  After reading other Amazon reviews it seems like this is a serious issue for some but not all.

Amazon delivery sent 2 movers who delivered it, unpacked it, attached the stand, plugged it up to make sure it worked and removed all the packaging. The TV is amazing in regards to the build quality, the ROKU operating system and the picture quality. The TV stand has the feet on the ends of the TV and just enough height, so it allowed me to place my JBL 3.1 soundbar directly underneath the TV for a clean finished look, while still having amazing sound. The remote is improved in its design and function. Amazon sells the premium version with the RF remote so you can point it anywhere and the TV will pick up the signal, unlike the BB version which comes with an IR remote and has to be pointed directly at the sensor on the TV or it won't work. The TCL remote is also slightly flatter and wider then previous TCL TV remotes and it fits in your hand better. They also made the play/pause button larger and with a slight indentation so you can work it in complete darkness simply by feel, which is great! Set up of the TV was a breeze with the ROKU operating system and basic picture adjustments are simple and straightforward using the TCL remote. You will need to download the ROKU app to make more intricate picture setting changes, but it too is very easy to use.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},

This TV rules. 4K videos look great on it. The audio is loud and rounded enough that I don't need a soundbar. As we speak I'm listening to the greatest hits of No Doubt on it. I spent a lot of time with the different video settings but, really, the default ones suit me fine. When I first turned this unit on the Smoothing effect was on high. I've since turned it off because even on low setting videos look like a soap opera. In my neck of the woods I don't get many over-the-air (OTA) channels and have to settle for just a handful of \"old people\" stations. The internet connection in my building is relatively weak; however, when it does work well, I can stream movies from VUDU in high definition without much interruptions. I plan to keep this piece of electronica around for a few years. I'd originally bought the 49\" inch version but, because my vision is not the greatest in the world, returned it for this 55 incher. Amazon refunded my money for the 49\" one rather quickly, too. All in all, one of the best purchases I've made in a long time.", "verification": "Verified Purchase", "product_type": null}},
