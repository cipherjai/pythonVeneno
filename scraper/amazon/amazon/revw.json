I often get so annoyed with the delayed response that I click the Home button to get back to all the apps in hopes of resetting and getting it moving better. It doesn't work; the apps continue to run slow.  If I was an avid TVer I would have to buy a new TV because this one is pretty frustrating.", "Works great! Husband loves it!!", "first thing you notice is how lite this TV is, we purchased a bracket to hold it and the bracket was heavier than the TV, I hold the TV by the corners when I move it because it does not feel very strong on the edges", "That being said!", "This is a great TV it has a good picture and reasonable sound, it is easy to set up and to navigate.", "does not have bluetooth so no adding speakers but it does have audio out.", "Got this smart tv for my grandpa, awesome quality for it's price. It even comes with a free subscription to Roku TV(a streaming service similar to Netflix).", "You can literally just plug it in, connect Wi-Fi and start streaming for free."], "Review_helpfulness": ["One person found this helpful"]},

So far it's working pretty smoothly. I am very impressed with the Roku feature and the fact that one can easily switch between Roku and Cable so easily. Thank you, Amazon workers!", "Terrible TV. Set up was easy, but tv screen turned dark within 10 min , then completely black. Did online trouble shooting , didnt fix. Spoke to representative and got free shipping to get fixed and supposedly sent back within 7-10 days. Hassel is not worth it. Would not recommend at all. Only bad rating I have EVER given.", "Nice little TV. A few quirks with the user interface, but overall very happy with it.", "Great picture and sound. Nice slim bezel.", "Absolutely terrible customer care, my tv stopped working a week after the warranty ran out! I called they said they would make an exception and cover me because it was so close to the end date. I sent all the information I was supposed to and then they went back on their word and said there was nothing they were willing to do. I didn\u2019t buy this tv for it to work for just one year! If I had known it was bad quality I would have chosen another manufacturer! NEVER buying TCL AGAIN!!!", "It looks like some people are having a not great experience with TCL. A friend of mine who deals in electronics told me that this brand was gaining popularity in the states and because it was not so well known, the prices were very affordable. Since he recommended it, we bought it in the 32 inch size. We had very few problems with the TV and if there were any issues, I\u2019m not so sure it wasn\u2019t our router causing them. I love being able to have Amazon Prime Video,  YouTube, Netflix, PBS Kids and all sorts of other channels available without additional hardware.", "We liked the TV so much that we bought the same TV in a bigger size to replace it. Our old TV was still in such great shape that I sold it and made a bunch my money back. Obviously, this is not the Cadillac of smart TVs. Some people seem to be getting duds. But I haven\u2019t had any notable problems with ours. One thing I really like is the small intuitive remote. I\u2019m so done with crazy complicated remotes. This one gets you where you need to go fast.", "I bought this for my grandma to replace her Samsung that went out on her. I am more than satisfied with this TV especially for the price!", "Love it so much I'm planning on buying a 65 inch for Christmas!", "Works at native HD resolutions with a wireless connection to my Plex system. Be sure to get the TCL app, not an imitation..."], "Review_helpfulness": ["One person found this helpful"]}
