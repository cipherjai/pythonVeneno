These issues weren't associated with my internet connection, but with the operation of the Roku OS. After these slowdowns began, video streaming was absolutely crippled. I am unable to watch any media through Netflix, Hulu, Prime video, or Acorn, as they will just buffer indefinitely. Streaming is still perfect on a laptop or phone in the same vicinity, but the television just can't handle it.

To me, nothing over 40\" is necessary for our living room. To her, nothing over 32\". This TV fit the bill perfectly, at least in size. The tiny bezel was perfect! It's pretty much the exact same size as our old TV! So we both win! My only gripe is with Roku. It is SLOOOOOW!

And it only seems to get worse as time goes by. We have this connected to an HTPC, and Ruko has taken much of the load off the PC, but sometimes its sluggishness is just too much to deal with. Another annoyance is the remote, it's got a really weird line of sight. We sit about 7 feet away from the screen and you have to hold it up and aim it at a weird angle for the TV to respond (there's nothing in between us and the TV).

First, I've order this exact TV twice.  One 14 months ago and it arrived with a broken screen. Not a problem with TCL television that it was damaged. Amazon is excellent with issues like this and immediately resolved the issue by replacing the TV.. The replaced TV lasted maybe 366 days before it started acting up. That was a TCL problem.  After a failed Seagate back-up drive 18 months ago (never happened before in 30 years) I've always purchased the longest extended warranty available. The warranty I purchased was excellent as well (SmartGuard). They provided me with an exact same make and model TV, which ALSO arrived with a broken screen.  Again Amazon was again excellent with this issue and I had a new TV in two days.  I again purchased the longest warranty available.  With the actual TV and its performance, I do sincerely really like it.  I want to recommend you buy it but I wouldn't buy anything these days without the warranty.  In the last two years I've not purchased an electronic device that has not failed after the initial warranty expired.

I'm no longer hesitate to buy brands I've never heard of because they are less expensive.  They work as well or better than I expected and broke down at the same rate as \"name brand\" products.

This thing has been streaming for 16 hours a day for an invalid since we got it last week. Other than being a bit clumsy to search on, (compared to having a keyboard) it is absolutely wonderful, and ESPECIALLY considering the price.

Also, its computer would decide to pause itself once in a while, and he has no idea how to get it back on track, let alone the thing getting bogged down from his interfacing the touch screen.

Anyway, it is clear as a bell, and other than the fact that if you prefer head banger sound, you probably wouldn't get a thumpy bass out of it, (thank GOD) what more can you ask for?  I have it sitting on about 45% volume and can hear it clearly in other rooms. Oh, the oddest thing is that if you want to see closed captioning (a MUST for us) on Netflix, you have to DE-select captioning on \"\u00e4lways\" and instead select captioning  \"on mute only\" and you'll get the captions. While it's NOT on mute. HAHAHA. Took me a while to figure that one out, and only after unplugging everything etc. I wouldn't have even TRIED it on that setting except that it HAD been working before, so I was going through every possibility in case its computer had gotten stuck.
